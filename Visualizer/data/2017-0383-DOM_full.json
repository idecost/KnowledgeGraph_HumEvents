      "answer": "The news reports indicate that storm surges during the storm in the Dominican Republic directly led to flooding in affected areas. Specifically, it is reported that Maria began to spread its destructive winds, flooding rain, and storm surge into the northeastern Dominican Republic, which implies that these elements contributed to the flooding experienced in the region [1]. Additionally, the Yuna River overflowed, which is a direct consequence of the excessive rainfall and storm surge, leading to flooding in the affected areas [2].",

By categorizing the alerts into yellow and green, authorities could prioritize areas based on the level of risk, allowing for more targeted and effective responses to the storm's threats.",
