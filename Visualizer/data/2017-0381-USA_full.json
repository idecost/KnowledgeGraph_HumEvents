      "question": "What specific meteorological data or eyewitness accounts from news articles provide evidence of the high winds caused by Hurricane Irma during its impact on the United States?",
      "answer": "Hurricane Irma caused significant high winds during its impact on the United States, as evidenced by both meteorological data and eyewitness accounts. Meteorological data reported peak wind gusts in various locations, such as 120 mph at Big Pine Key, 94 mph at Vaca Key, and 93 mph at Alligator Reef Light [1]. Additionally, eyewitness accounts describe the intense wind conditions. For instance, a Times reporter in Fort Myers noted that the wind varied by the minute, at times building to a gale and generating a low howl, causing steel poles to vibrate like tuning forks [2]. Another account from West Kendall described the wind tearing through trees, splitting a tree in half, and causing metal gates to blow open [2]. These reports collectively provide a detailed picture of the high winds experienced during Hurricane Irma's passage through Florida.",

And soon after came the floodwaters, with water levels in Naples increasing 7 feet in just 90 minutes. As the storm's trajectory took it north, water was sucked from part of Tampa Bay, exposing a muddy expanse that would normally be underwater — a frightening portent of flooding to come when that water, and more, comes rushing back. \"MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\" appealed the National Hurricane Center after photos on social media showed people and dogs frolicking on the bay's exposed sand. The cities bracketing Tampa Bay — Tampa and St. Petersburg, with a population of some 3 million people between them — were forecast to be clobbered later Sunday by sustained hurricane-force winds. A direct hit on the area would be the first in nearly a century. \"We are about to get punched in the face by this storm,\" declared Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn. The storm's passage by no means marks the end of the danger. \"Once this system passes through, it's going to be a race to save lives and sustain lives,\" William B. \"Brock\" Long, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" With the storm on a havoc-filled trajectory, much of Florida was a jumbled tableau of overflowing shelters, boarded-up buildings and deserted streets in normally bustling urban centers.

Marco Rubio said on “The Today Show.” “Not from the water.” Houston was underwater the last week of August. A water storm. Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways?

There remained more than 160,000 people waiting in shelters across the state Monday. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Monday morning the state was “aggressively” working to get search-and-rescue teams to help with the flooding in Jacksonville and that the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York & the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were being made available for rescue operations.

      "question": "What specific meteorological conditions during Hurricane Irma led to the formation of storm surges along the coastlines of the United States, and what evidence from news reports supports this causal relationship?",
      "answer": "Hurricane Irma's meteorological conditions that led to the formation of storm surges along the coastlines of the United States were primarily due to its status as a powerful Category 4 storm with significant wind speeds and its trajectory over coastal areas. As Irma passed over the Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm and made landfall at Marco Island as a Category 3 storm, it brought with it high winds and low atmospheric pressure, which are key factors in storm surge formation [1]. The National Weather Service reported a ten-foot storm surge on Cudjoe Key, with inland water levels reaching ten to fourteen feet, illustrating the impact of these conditions [1].\n\nAdditionally, Irma's storm surge pushed water ashore at high tide, exacerbating flooding conditions, as seen along the Georgia coast and on Tybee Island, where waist-deep water was reported in the streets [2]. The storm's trajectory also caused water to be sucked from parts of Tampa Bay, exposing normally submerged areas, which was a precursor to the anticipated return of water and additional flooding [3]. These reports highlight the causal relationship between Irma's meteorological conditions and the resulting storm surges along the U.S. coastlines.",

Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

There remained more than 160,000 people waiting in shelters across the state Monday. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Monday morning the state was “aggressively” working to get search-and-rescue teams to help with the flooding in Jacksonville and that the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York & the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were being made available for rescue operations.

      "answer": "During Hurricane Irma, several instances of infrastructure damage in the United States were directly attributed to high winds. In Fort Myers, the winds were described as varying in intensity, at times building to a gale, causing eight-foot steel poles with 'handicapped parking' signs to vibrate like tuning forks [1]. In Miami, the storm uprooted trees and threw some boats from their moorings, indicating the force of the winds [2]. On Marco Island, Irma's winds reached 130 miles per hour, causing significant damage, particularly on the south end of the island, with many streets covered with water to mailbox depth [2]. Additionally, in the Florida Keys, the National Weather Service reported a ten-foot storm surge on Cudjoe Key, with inland water levels reaching ten to fourteen feet, further demonstrating the impact of the high winds [3].",

Marco Rubio said on “The Today Show.” “Not from the water.” Houston was underwater the last week of August. A water storm. Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

      "answer": "The storm surges during Hurricane Irma led to significant flooding in various affected areas in the United States. In South Carolina, the storm generated a nearly 10-foot tide, which was 4 feet more than normal, causing incredible flooding in Downtown Charleston and other coastal areas like Hilton Head and Beaufort [1]. In Georgia, the storm surge pushed water ashore at high tide, exacerbating flooding along the coast, including on Tybee Island, where streets were waist-deep in water [2]. In Florida, the storm surge caused floodwaters to inundate numerous towns and cities, with Jacksonville experiencing significant flooding [3]. Additionally, in the Florida Keys, a 10-foot storm surge was reported on Cudjoe Key, with inland water levels reaching 10 to 14 feet [4]. These reports highlight the severe impact of storm surges in causing widespread flooding during Hurricane Irma.",

The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Monday morning the state was “aggressively” working to get search-and-rescue teams to help with the flooding in Jacksonville and that the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York & the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were being made available for rescue operations.

Marco Rubio said on “The Today Show.” “Not from the water.” Houston was underwater the last week of August. A water storm. Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

And soon after came the floodwaters, with water levels in Naples increasing 7 feet in just 90 minutes. As the storm's trajectory took it north, water was sucked from part of Tampa Bay, exposing a muddy expanse that would normally be underwater — a frightening portent of flooding to come when that water, and more, comes rushing back. \"MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\" appealed the National Hurricane Center after photos on social media showed people and dogs frolicking on the bay's exposed sand. The cities bracketing Tampa Bay — Tampa and St. Petersburg, with a population of some 3 million people between them — were forecast to be clobbered later Sunday by sustained hurricane-force winds. A direct hit on the area would be the first in nearly a century. \"We are about to get punched in the face by this storm,\" declared Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn. The storm's passage by no means marks the end of the danger. \"Once this system passes through, it's going to be a race to save lives and sustain lives,\" William B. \"Brock\" Long, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" With the storm on a havoc-filled trajectory, much of Florida was a jumbled tableau of overflowing shelters, boarded-up buildings and deserted streets in normally bustling urban centers.

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

I think the focus truly should be on the damage that’s happening in the Keys and the damage that’s happening in Jacksonville. We are the fortunate ones.” If anything, he said, the significant damage to his city will be measured in downtime — putting up shutters, taking them down, having to incur unexpected lodging costs for residents and then cleaning up after the storm. “I think there will be the lost opportunity costs and I think it will be the damage to our residents — their livelihoods, any damage to their homes and of course to their lives,” Levine stressed. “But we’re getting back as soon as the power is restored fully. I think that Miami beach is going to be 100 percent on target.\" Levine predicted that all of the major oceanfront hotels will be fully operational by the end of the week, including the Eden Roc, which he toured with General Manager Laurence Dubey before heading to other nearby hotels. Of course Miami Beach has faced bigger challenges over the years —most recently Zika, a flood this summer and even during World War II when the then Army Air Corps commandeered oceanfront hotels to train for the invasion of Normandy. To a large extent, Levine is counting that Florida Power & Light will get his city up and running as quickly as possible",

Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning.

The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways?

And soon after came the floodwaters, with water levels in Naples increasing 7 feet in just 90 minutes. As the storm's trajectory took it north, water was sucked from part of Tampa Bay, exposing a muddy expanse that would normally be underwater — a frightening portent of flooding to come when that water, and more, comes rushing back. \"MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\" appealed the National Hurricane Center after photos on social media showed people and dogs frolicking on the bay's exposed sand. The cities bracketing Tampa Bay — Tampa and St. Petersburg, with a population of some 3 million people between them — were forecast to be clobbered later Sunday by sustained hurricane-force winds. A direct hit on the area would be the first in nearly a century. \"We are about to get punched in the face by this storm,\" declared Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn. The storm's passage by no means marks the end of the danger. \"Once this system passes through, it's going to be a race to save lives and sustain lives,\" William B. \"Brock\" Long, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" With the storm on a havoc-filled trajectory, much of Florida was a jumbled tableau of overflowing shelters, boarded-up buildings and deserted streets in normally bustling urban centers. Palm trees blew sideways, with fronds snapping under the assault; tree branches flew like missiles",

I think the focus truly should be on the damage that’s happening in the Keys and the damage that’s happening in Jacksonville. We are the fortunate ones.” If anything, he said, the significant damage to his city will be measured in downtime — putting up shutters, taking them down, having to incur unexpected lodging costs for residents and then cleaning up after the storm. “I think there will be the lost opportunity costs and I think it will be the damage to our residents — their livelihoods, any damage to their homes and of course to their lives,” Levine stressed. “But we’re getting back as soon as the power is restored fully. I think that Miami beach is going to be 100 percent on target.\" Levine predicted that all of the major oceanfront hotels will be fully operational by the end of the week, including the Eden Roc, which he toured with General Manager Laurence Dubey before heading to other nearby hotels. Of course Miami Beach has faced bigger challenges over the years —most recently Zika, a flood this summer and even during World War II when the then Army Air Corps commandeered oceanfront hotels to train for the invasion of Normandy. To a large extent, Levine is counting that Florida Power & Light will get his city up and running as quickly as possible",

          "content": "IRMA ON MONDAY Florida faces more winds, flooding and outages In one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history, nearly 7 million people in the Southeast were warned to seek shelter elsewhere – including 6.4 million in Florida alone. There remained more than 160,000 people waiting in shelters across the state Monday. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Monday morning the state was “aggressively” working to get search-and-rescue teams to help with the flooding in Jacksonville and that the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York & the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were being made available for rescue operations. Scott activated all 7,000 members of the Florida National Guard, and 10,000 guardsmen from elsewhere were being deployed to the state to help with the task",

      "answer": "During Hurricane Irma, several specific instances of flooding led to road closures in the United States. In Jacksonville, Florida, flooding was reported in the historic district of St. Augustine, with some streets already flooded and only emergency vehicles on the road [1]. Additionally, in Mandarin, Jacksonville, there were barricades up due to almost 3 inches of standing water on Indian Walk Road off Hartley Road [1].\n\nIn South Carolina, incredible flooding occurred in Downtown Charleston, with the National Weather Service reporting a nearly 10-foot tide, which was among the worst tidal surges in 80 years [2]. This flooding led to road closures and delays in more than a dozen counties as employees dealt with the storm's aftermath [2].\n\nThese reports highlight the significant impact of flooding on transportation infrastructure during Hurricane Irma, causing road closures and hindering travel in affected areas.",

      "question": "What specific mechanisms or events during the storm in the United States led to flooding that resulted in damage to utilities, and what evidence is there from news reports to support this causal relationship?",
      "answer": "The flooding during Hurricane Irma in the United States was primarily caused by a combination of storm surge and heavy rainfall, which led to significant damage to utilities. In Florida, the storm surge inundated numerous towns and cities, contributing to widespread power outages. For instance, more than 6.5 million residents in Florida were left without power, which was roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state [1]. The storm surge and flooding were so severe that the Environmental Protection Agency issued a waiver allowing Florida electricity companies to violate clean air and water standards temporarily to restore electricity supplies [2].\n\nIn Georgia, communities along the coast experienced extensive flooding due to Irma's storm surge, which was exacerbated by high tide and heavy rainfall. This flooding led to water entering homes and damaging infrastructure, such as piers and boat docks in St. Marys [2]. Similarly, in South Carolina, the storm generated a nearly 10-foot tide, which was among the worst tidal surges in 80 years, causing incredible flooding in areas like Downtown Charleston and leading to power outages [3].\n\nThe combination of these factors—storm surge, high tides, and heavy rainfall—created conditions that overwhelmed drainage systems and led to significant flooding, which in turn caused damage to utilities and infrastructure across the affected regions [3][2][1].",

Marco Rubio said on “The Today Show.” “Not from the water.” Houston was underwater the last week of August. A water storm. Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

      "question": "What specific instances of infrastructure damage during the storm in the United States led to significant economic losses, and how were these losses quantified in news reports?",
      "answer": "Hurricane Irma caused significant infrastructure damage in various parts of the United States, leading to substantial economic losses. In Miami, the storm resulted in power outages and damage to trees and boats, with the Miami International Airport suffering storm damage that led to its closure, impacting travel and commerce [1]. The economic losses in Miami were also attributed to downtime, as residents and businesses had to deal with putting up and taking down shutters, unexpected lodging costs, and cleanup efforts [2].\n\nIn Naples, Collier County experienced significant damage to its water and sewer infrastructure, with 93% of the county without power, which would have contributed to economic losses due to disruptions in essential services [1]. The Florida Keys faced extensive damage, with much of the area without power and water, and the closure of all three hospitals, including their emergency rooms, which would have had a significant economic impact on healthcare services and tourism [3].\n\nIn South Carolina, particularly in Charleston, the storm generated a nearly 10-foot tide, causing incredible flooding that was among the worst tidal surges in 80 years. This flooding would have led to economic losses due to damage to infrastructure and disruptions in business operations [4]. Additionally, the storm's impact on the Florida Keys required a significant recovery effort, with 35 trucks and 100 workers dispatched to restore power, indicating the scale of economic resources needed for recovery [3].\n\nThese instances highlight the widespread infrastructure damage caused by Hurricane Irma, leading to significant economic losses due to disruptions in power, water, transportation, and essential services. However, specific quantifications of these economic losses in terms of monetary value were not detailed in the provided sources.",

Some, but not all, storm warnings in Florida have been discontinued, but storm surge is still expected along western Florida and from around Daytona Beach to South Carolina. South Carolina, Alabama and north central Georgia are expected to get 3 to 6 inches (7 to 15 centimeters) of rain with spots hitting 10 inches (25 centimeters). Northern Mississippi and southern Tennessee and parts of North Carolina are forecast to get 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain. 5 p.m. Officials say the 42-bridge roadway that connects the Florida Keys to each other and the mainland must be checked for safety before motorists can be allowed back onto the islands. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Monday that once officials are able to inspect, and to clear debris and sand from the Overseas Highway, it should be usable again. Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said in an email Monday afternoon that the Keys are still closed to residents and visitors as crews work to make the roads safe. Much of the Keys are still without power and water. There are 35 trucks and 100 workers heading from Jacksonville to Key West to help restore power to Keys Energy, which services the Lower Keys. All three of the Keys' hospitals are closed, including their emergency rooms, though emergency responders and medical personel have been allowed to enter the Keys",

Some, but not all, storm warnings in Florida have been discontinued, but storm surge is still expected along western Florida and from around Daytona Beach to South Carolina. South Carolina, Alabama and north central Georgia are expected to get 3 to 6 inches (7 to 15 centimeters) of rain with spots hitting 10 inches (25 centimeters). Northern Mississippi and southern Tennessee and parts of North Carolina are forecast to get 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain. 5 p.m. Officials say the 42-bridge roadway that connects the Florida Keys to each other and the mainland must be checked for safety before motorists can be allowed back onto the islands. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Monday that once officials are able to inspect, and to clear debris and sand from the Overseas Highway, it should be usable again. Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said in an email Monday afternoon that the Keys are still closed to residents and visitors as crews work to make the roads safe. Much of the Keys are still without power and water. There are 35 trucks and 100 workers heading from Jacksonville to Key West to help restore power to Keys Energy, which services the Lower Keys. All three of the Keys' hospitals are closed, including their emergency rooms, though emergency responders and medical personel have been allowed to enter the Keys",

Marco Rubio said on “The Today Show.” “Not from the water.” Houston was underwater the last week of August. A water storm. Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

      "question": "What specific instances of utilities damage during the storm in the United States led to power outages, and what evidence from news reports supports this causal relationship?",
      "answer": "Hurricane Irma caused significant damage to utilities, leading to widespread power outages across the United States. In Florida, more than 6.5 million customers were left without power, which accounted for roughly 65% of all customers in the state [1][2]. The storm's impact on infrastructure was severe, with numerous towns and cities inundated by floodwaters from the storm surge, further complicating power restoration efforts [1]. In the Florida Keys, there was no water, power, or cell service, highlighting the extensive damage to utilities in that area [2]. Additionally, in Brevard County, significant power outages were reported, with many traffic signals not operational and roadways obstructed by debris or water [2].\n\nIn Georgia, more than 1.3 million customers experienced power outages due to the storm [3]. The extensive flooding along the Georgia coast, particularly on Tybee Island and in downtown St. Marys, contributed to the damage of utilities, as floodwaters entered homes and damaged piers and boat docks [4]. In South Carolina, 161,000 customers were without power, further illustrating the widespread impact of the storm on utilities across the Southeast [3].\n\nThese reports collectively demonstrate the causal relationship between Hurricane Irma's destructive force and the resulting power outages, as the storm's high winds, flooding, and storm surge severely damaged utility infrastructure across multiple states.",

I think the focus truly should be on the damage that’s happening in the Keys and the damage that’s happening in Jacksonville. We are the fortunate ones.” If anything, he said, the significant damage to his city will be measured in downtime — putting up shutters, taking them down, having to incur unexpected lodging costs for residents and then cleaning up after the storm. “I think there will be the lost opportunity costs and I think it will be the damage to our residents — their livelihoods, any damage to their homes and of course to their lives,” Levine stressed. “But we’re getting back as soon as the power is restored fully. I think that Miami beach is going to be 100 percent on target.\" Levine predicted that all of the major oceanfront hotels will be fully operational by the end of the week, including the Eden Roc, which he toured with General Manager Laurence Dubey before heading to other nearby hotels. Of course Miami Beach has faced bigger challenges over the years —most recently Zika, a flood this summer and even during World War II when the then Army Air Corps commandeered oceanfront hotels to train for the invasion of Normandy. To a large extent, Levine is counting that Florida Power & Light will get his city up and running as quickly as possible",

Irma’s storm surge pushed water ashore at the high tide Monday afternoon, and heavy rainfall made the flooding even worse. On Tybee Island east of Savannah, Hollard Zellers saw waist-deep water in the street as he went to fetch a kayak. About 3,000 people live on Tybee Island, which is Georgia’s largest public beach. City manager Shawn Gillen said the waters seemed to be receding quickly, but most of the island appeared to have some level of flooding and water was in many homes. Storm surge also sent floodwaters into downtown St. Marys just north of the Georgia-Florida line. St. Marys police Lt. Shannon Brock said piers and boat docks were heavily damaged and many boats sunk. 2:30 p.m. State and federal environmental regulators have issued a blanket waiver for Florida electricity companies to violate clean air and water standards for the next two weeks. The Environmental Protection Agency announced the decision in a letter issued Monday as Hurricane Irma blew through the state. The agency said the so-called No Action Assurance granted through Sept. 26 will provide Florida utility generators needed flexibility to maintain and restore electricity supplies",

      "answer": "During Hurricane Irma, significant power outages led to widespread disruptions across several states in the United States. In Florida, more than 6.5 million residents were left without power, which accounted for roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state [1]. This massive outage affected numerous towns and cities, causing disruptions in daily life and emergency services [1]. In the Florida Keys, there was no water, power, or cell service, which severely hampered recovery efforts and communication [2]. Additionally, in Brevard County, significant power outages rendered many traffic signals non-operational, and debris obstructed roadways, making travel dangerous and impeding the ability of public service agencies to restore safe conditions [2].\n\nIn Georgia, more than 1.3 million customers experienced power outages, further complicating the recovery process [3]. South Carolina also faced substantial disruptions, with 161,000 customers without power, affecting the ability to manage the storm's aftermath effectively [3]. These outages were part of a broader pattern of disruption across the Southeast, where massive power failures were a critical challenge in the storm's wake [3].",

I think the focus truly should be on the damage that’s happening in the Keys and the damage that’s happening in Jacksonville. We are the fortunate ones.” If anything, he said, the significant damage to his city will be measured in downtime — putting up shutters, taking them down, having to incur unexpected lodging costs for residents and then cleaning up after the storm. “I think there will be the lost opportunity costs and I think it will be the damage to our residents — their livelihoods, any damage to their homes and of course to their lives,” Levine stressed. “But we’re getting back as soon as the power is restored fully. I think that Miami beach is going to be 100 percent on target.\" Levine predicted that all of the major oceanfront hotels will be fully operational by the end of the week, including the Eden Roc, which he toured with General Manager Laurence Dubey before heading to other nearby hotels. Of course Miami Beach has faced bigger challenges over the years —most recently Zika, a flood this summer and even during World War II when the then Army Air Corps commandeered oceanfront hotels to train for the invasion of Normandy. To a large extent, Levine is counting that Florida Power & Light will get his city up and running as quickly as possible",

      "answer": "Hurricane Irma caused significant disruptions to transportation in the United States, primarily due to damage to infrastructure and power outages. In the Florida Keys, the 42-bridge roadway that connects the islands to the mainland had to be inspected for safety before it could be reopened to motorists, as debris and sand needed to be cleared from the Overseas Highway [1]. Additionally, U.S. 1, the major thoroughfare in the Keys, was still being cleared of debris, and gas was in short supply, further complicating transportation [2].\n\nIn South Carolina, the storm caused incredible flooding in areas such as Downtown Charleston, which led to road closures and delays as authorities dealt with the aftermath [3]. The flooding was severe enough to free a local landmark boat that had been deposited by a previous hurricane, indicating the extent of the water's impact on transportation routes [3].\n\nMoreover, the storm left more than 6.5 million residents in Florida without power, which affected traffic signals and other transportation-related infrastructure, contributing to transportation issues across the state [4]. These disruptions were compounded by the need for search-and-rescue operations, which were prioritized in areas like Jacksonville and the Keys, further straining transportation resources [5][4].",

There remained more than 160,000 people waiting in shelters across the state Monday. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Monday morning the state was “aggressively” working to get search-and-rescue teams to help with the flooding in Jacksonville and that the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York & the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were being made available for rescue operations. Scott activated all 7,000 members of the Florida National Guard, and 10,000 guardsmen from elsewhere were being deployed to the state to help with the task",

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Monday that once officials are able to inspect, and to clear debris and sand from the Overseas Highway, it should be usable again. Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said in an email Monday afternoon that the Keys are still closed to residents and visitors as crews work to make the roads safe. Much of the Keys are still without power and water. There are 35 trucks and 100 workers heading from Jacksonville to Key West to help restore power to Keys Energy, which services the Lower Keys. All three of the Keys' hospitals are closed, including their emergency rooms, though emergency responders and medical personel have been allowed to enter the Keys",

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day.

So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways?

There remained more than 160,000 people waiting in shelters across the state Monday. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Monday morning the state was “aggressively” working to get search-and-rescue teams to help with the flooding in Jacksonville and that the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York & the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were being made available for rescue operations. Scott activated all 7,000 members of the Florida National Guard, and 10,000 guardsmen from elsewhere were being deployed to the state to help with the task",

      "answer": "During Hurricane Irma, several disruptions led to communication issues in the United States. In the Florida Keys, the lack of internet and cell service was a significant problem, making it difficult for people to reach family members and friends who stayed during the storm [1]. This communication breakdown was primarily due to the extensive damage caused by the hurricane, which included fallen trees and broken lines that affected utilities and infrastructure [1].\n\nAdditionally, the storm's impact on transportation infrastructure contributed to communication challenges. Airports in major cities such as Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Fort Lauderdale were closed, and flights in Atlanta, GA, and Charlotte, NC, were delayed or canceled, further complicating communication and travel logistics [2]. These closures and delays were reported as part of the broader disruptions caused by the hurricane, which stretched emergency response resources and affected the ability to maintain regular communication channels [2].\n\nOverall, the combination of physical damage to infrastructure and the resulting logistical challenges significantly hindered communication during Hurricane Irma, as reported in various news articles [2][1].",

Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

Barbuda received damage to 95 percent of their buildings. Puerto Rico had large swaths of people lose their power. The Leeward Islands saw food, water and medicine shortages and looting.

      "answer": "During Hurricane Irma, several specific factors and circumstances led to fatalities in the United States, contributing to the overall impact of the storm. In Florida, the storm was directly responsible for five deaths. One man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, and another individual died after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. Additionally, a sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were killed in a two-car crash in Hardee County, and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related [1].\n\nThe storm's impact was exacerbated by the massive evacuation efforts, with nearly 7 million people in the Southeast, including 6.4 million in Florida, being warned to seek shelter elsewhere. This large-scale evacuation was one of the largest in U.S. history and highlighted the severity of the storm's threat [1]. Furthermore, more than 6.5 million residents in Florida were left without power, which was about 65 percent of all customers in the state, indicating the extensive damage to infrastructure [1].\n\nIn addition to the fatalities in Florida, Hurricane Irma also claimed lives in Georgia, where three deaths were reported. The storm's wide reach and the extensive flooding it caused in areas like Tybee Island and St. Marys contributed to the hazardous conditions that led to these fatalities [2].\n\nOverall, the combination of high winds, flooding, infrastructure damage, and the challenges of evacuation and emergency response contributed significantly to the fatalities and the broader impact of Hurricane Irma in the United States [1][2].",

And soon after came the floodwaters, with water levels in Naples increasing 7 feet in just 90 minutes. As the storm's trajectory took it north, water was sucked from part of Tampa Bay, exposing a muddy expanse that would normally be underwater — a frightening portent of flooding to come when that water, and more, comes rushing back. \"MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\" appealed the National Hurricane Center after photos on social media showed people and dogs frolicking on the bay's exposed sand. The cities bracketing Tampa Bay — Tampa and St. Petersburg, with a population of some 3 million people between them — were forecast to be clobbered later Sunday by sustained hurricane-force winds. A direct hit on the area would be the first in nearly a century. \"We are about to get punched in the face by this storm,\" declared Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn. The storm's passage by no means marks the end of the danger. \"Once this system passes through, it's going to be a race to save lives and sustain lives,\" William B. \"Brock\" Long, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" With the storm on a havoc-filled trajectory, much of Florida was a jumbled tableau of overflowing shelters, boarded-up buildings and deserted streets in normally bustling urban centers.

Irma’s storm surge pushed water ashore at the high tide Monday afternoon, and heavy rainfall made the flooding even worse. On Tybee Island east of Savannah, Hollard Zellers saw waist-deep water in the street as he went to fetch a kayak. About 3,000 people live on Tybee Island, which is Georgia’s largest public beach. City manager Shawn Gillen said the waters seemed to be receding quickly, but most of the island appeared to have some level of flooding and water was in many homes. Storm surge also sent floodwaters into downtown St. Marys just north of the Georgia-Florida line. St. Marys police Lt. Shannon Brock said piers and boat docks were heavily damaged and many boats sunk. 2:30 p.m. State and federal environmental regulators have issued a blanket waiver for Florida electricity companies to violate clean air and water standards for the next two weeks. The Environmental Protection Agency announced the decision in a letter issued Monday as Hurricane Irma blew through the state. The agency said the so-called No Action Assurance granted through Sept. 26 will provide Florida utility generators needed flexibility to maintain and restore electricity supplies",

Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Monday that once officials are able to inspect, and to clear debris and sand from the Overseas Highway, it should be usable again. Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said in an email Monday afternoon that the Keys are still closed to residents and visitors as crews work to make the roads safe.

      "answer": "The implementation of evacuation plans during Hurricane Irma in the United States played a crucial role in preventing fatalities, as evidenced by several news reports. In one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history, nearly 7 million people in the Southeast were warned to seek shelter elsewhere, including 6.4 million in Florida alone [1]. This massive evacuation effort was critical in minimizing the loss of life, as the storm was responsible for five deaths in Florida, which is relatively low given the storm's severity [1].\n\nIn Lee County, Florida, officials acknowledged the challenge of housing everyone who needed or wanted to evacuate in shelters, urging people to find shelter with friends or family if possible [2]. This proactive approach helped manage the large number of evacuees and ensured that those who needed shelter could find it.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies were actively involved in assessing damage and ensuring safety in affected areas, such as Jacksonville, where they focused on lifesaving and life-sustaining priorities [3]. The coordinated efforts of federal, state, and local agencies, along with the public's compliance with evacuation orders, contributed to the relatively low number of fatalities during the storm.",

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now.

Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

Barbuda received damage to 95 percent of their buildings. Puerto Rico had large swaths of people lose their power. The Leeward Islands saw food, water and medicine shortages and looting. The U.S. is sending a flight Monday to St. Martin to evacuates its citizens stuck there. As the storm moves away from Florida, massive clean up efforts will have to take place. British business magnate Richard Branson who owns a destroyed private island in the Caribbean has called for a “Marshall Plan” — like effort to aid the islands.​\n\nBefore Cassini spacecraft takes its death dive into Saturn to end its NASA mission, it took images of jets of water and organic matter rocketing out of the moon Enceladus’ south pole.",

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

Heather Nauert I awoke this morning saddened by the devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean and concerned for those in Florida and the southeastern United States who will be affected by this storm. Our condolences are with those who have lost so much, including their loved ones, from the destruction of Hurricane Irma.\n\nAt times like these, I am reminded to \"look for the helpers,\" and in my case, I do not have to go far to find them. Yesterday, employees from the State Department’s San Juan and Dallas Passport Agencies assisted in the evacuation of U.S. citizens from St. Maarten. The employee from the San Juan Passport Agency was particularly selfless, as he undertook these actions despite the fact that he and his loved ones had also been affected by the storm. As of this morning, more than 1,200 U.S. citizens have been evacuated from St. Maarten since Friday. I have also seen my colleagues in Washington approach this situation with ingenuity and determination. As the Department was reaching out to hotels in the Caribbean to assist American citizens affected by the storm, two of my public affairs colleagues – one of whom has family facing the storm in Florida – reached out to Airbnb, and as a result we were able to assist additional U.S. citizens in the region. We are grateful for Airbnb's cooperation in these efforts.",

The National Hurricane Center issued warnings, such as urging people to \"MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\" when water was sucked from Tampa Bay, indicating the potential for dangerous flooding when the water returned [2]. These warnings and evacuations were crucial in reducing fatalities by encouraging people to leave high-risk areas and seek safety in shelters, which were filled to capacity across Florida [3][1].

And soon after came the floodwaters, with water levels in Naples increasing 7 feet in just 90 minutes. As the storm's trajectory took it north, water was sucked from part of Tampa Bay, exposing a muddy expanse that would normally be underwater — a frightening portent of flooding to come when that water, and more, comes rushing back. \"MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\" appealed the National Hurricane Center after photos on social media showed people and dogs frolicking on the bay's exposed sand. The cities bracketing Tampa Bay — Tampa and St. Petersburg, with a population of some 3 million people between them — were forecast to be clobbered later Sunday by sustained hurricane-force winds. A direct hit on the area would be the first in nearly a century. \"We are about to get punched in the face by this storm,\" declared Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn.

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

Rick Scott will head to the Keys to assess damage Monday, after the island chain was pummeled. “We are doing everything we can to get food and water throughout the state,” Scott said on Fox News Monday. “Most importantly we have got to save every life and we have got to make sure people understand it is still dangerous.” Several Caribbean islands may be in the worst shape after the storm. Barbuda received damage to 95 percent of their buildings. Puerto Rico had large swaths of people lose their power. The Leeward Islands saw food, water and medicine shortages and looting.

And soon after came the floodwaters, with water levels in Naples increasing 7 feet in just 90 minutes. As the storm's trajectory took it north, water was sucked from part of Tampa Bay, exposing a muddy expanse that would normally be underwater — a frightening portent of flooding to come when that water, and more, comes rushing back. \"MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\" appealed the National Hurricane Center after photos on social media showed people and dogs frolicking on the bay's exposed sand. The cities bracketing Tampa Bay — Tampa and St. Petersburg, with a population of some 3 million people between them — were forecast to be clobbered later Sunday by sustained hurricane-force winds. A direct hit on the area would be the first in nearly a century. \"We are about to get punched in the face by this storm,\" declared Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn. The storm's passage by no means marks the end of the danger. \"Once this system passes through, it's going to be a race to save lives and sustain lives,\" William B. \"Brock\" Long, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" With the storm on a havoc-filled trajectory, much of Florida was a jumbled tableau of overflowing shelters, boarded-up buildings and deserted streets in normally bustling urban centers.

We are the fortunate ones.” If anything, he said, the significant damage to his city will be measured in downtime — putting up shutters, taking them down, having to incur unexpected lodging costs for residents and then cleaning up after the storm. “I think there will be the lost opportunity costs and I think it will be the damage to our residents — their livelihoods, any damage to their homes and of course to their lives,” Levine stressed. “But we’re getting back as soon as the power is restored fully. I think that Miami beach is going to be 100 percent on target.\" Levine predicted that all of the major oceanfront hotels will be fully operational by the end of the week, including the Eden Roc, which he toured with General Manager Laurence Dubey before heading to other nearby hotels. Of course Miami Beach has faced bigger challenges over the years —most recently Zika, a flood this summer and even during World War II when the then Army Air Corps commandeered oceanfront hotels to train for the invasion of Normandy.

(The office reported a few minutes later that ther rescue was successful.)\n\n“The winds keep tearing through the trees outside. Something slammed into the door and made us all jump — it was loud enough to puncture the sounds of the wind and rain. Our metal gate was blown open, swaying back and forth. Outside, a tree is split in half, limbs bent over a wooden fence. The trees that are standing creak as the wind pushes them around. The shutters are creaking with the force of the wind, rattling against the windows. ‘I’m glad to have impact windows, get a chance to see outside,’ my mother just said.” — EMILY COCHRAN, a Times reporter , in West Kendall at 8:55 a.m.",

Some, but not all, storm warnings in Florida have been discontinued, but storm surge is still expected along western Florida and from around Daytona Beach to South Carolina. South Carolina, Alabama and north central Georgia are expected to get 3 to 6 inches (7 to 15 centimeters) of rain with spots hitting 10 inches (25 centimeters). Northern Mississippi and southern Tennessee and parts of North Carolina are forecast to get 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain. 5 p.m. Officials say the 42-bridge roadway that connects the Florida Keys to each other and the mainland must be checked for safety before motorists can be allowed back onto the islands. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Monday that once officials are able to inspect, and to clear debris and sand from the Overseas Highway, it should be usable again. Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said in an email Monday afternoon that the Keys are still closed to residents and visitors as crews work to make the roads safe. Much of the Keys are still without power and water. There are 35 trucks and 100 workers heading from Jacksonville to Key West to help restore power to Keys Energy, which services the Lower Keys. All three of the Keys' hospitals are closed, including their emergency rooms, though emergency responders and medical personel have been allowed to enter the Keys",

On Tybee Island east of Savannah, Hollard Zellers saw waist-deep water in the street as he went to fetch a kayak. About 3,000 people live on Tybee Island, which is Georgia’s largest public beach. City manager Shawn Gillen said the waters seemed to be receding quickly, but most of the island appeared to have some level of flooding and water was in many homes. Storm surge also sent floodwaters into downtown St. Marys just north of the Georgia-Florida line. St. Marys police Lt.

On Tybee Island east of Savannah, Hollard Zellers saw waist-deep water in the street as he went to fetch a kayak. About 3,000 people live on Tybee Island, which is Georgia’s largest public beach. City manager Shawn Gillen said the waters seemed to be receding quickly, but most of the island appeared to have some level of flooding and water was in many homes. Storm surge also sent floodwaters into downtown St. Marys just north of the Georgia-Florida line. St. Marys police Lt. Shannon Brock said piers and boat docks were heavily damaged and many boats sunk. 2:30 p.m. State and federal environmental regulators have issued a blanket waiver for Florida electricity companies to violate clean air and water standards for the next two weeks. The Environmental Protection Agency announced the decision in a letter issued Monday as Hurricane Irma blew through the state. The agency said the so-called No Action Assurance granted through Sept. 26 will provide Florida utility generators needed flexibility to maintain and restore electricity supplies",

South Carolina, Alabama and north central Georgia are expected to get 3 to 6 inches (7 to 15 centimeters) of rain with spots hitting 10 inches (25 centimeters). Northern Mississippi and southern Tennessee and parts of North Carolina are forecast to get 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain. 5 p.m. Officials say the 42-bridge roadway that connects the Florida Keys to each other and the mainland must be checked for safety before motorists can be allowed back onto the islands. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Monday that once officials are able to inspect, and to clear debris and sand from the Overseas Highway, it should be usable again. Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said in an email Monday afternoon that the Keys are still closed to residents and visitors as crews work to make the roads safe. Much of the Keys are still without power and water. There are 35 trucks and 100 workers heading from Jacksonville to Key West to help restore power to Keys Energy, which services the Lower Keys. All three of the Keys' hospitals are closed, including their emergency rooms, though emergency responders and medical personel have been allowed to enter the Keys",

The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day.

Barbuda received damage to 95 percent of their buildings. Puerto Rico had large swaths of people lose their power. The Leeward Islands saw food, water and medicine shortages and looting.

And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now.

There remained more than 160,000 people waiting in shelters across the state Monday. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Monday morning the state was “aggressively” working to get search-and-rescue teams to help with the flooding in Jacksonville and that the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York & the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were being made available for rescue operations.

(The office reported a few minutes later that ther rescue was successful.)\n\n“The winds keep tearing through the trees outside. Something slammed into the door and made us all jump — it was loud enough to puncture the sounds of the wind and rain. Our metal gate was blown open, swaying back and forth. Outside, a tree is split in half, limbs bent over a wooden fence. The trees that are standing creak as the wind pushes them around. The shutters are creaking with the force of the wind, rattling against the windows. ‘I’m glad to have impact windows, get a chance to see outside,’ my mother just said.” — EMILY COCHRAN, a Times reporter , in West Kendall at 8:55 a.m.",

These systems have also influenced response and recovery efforts by enabling coordinated actions such as the deployment of resources and personnel to affected areas, as seen with the strategic positioning of military assets and the distribution of essential supplies [2][3].",

How Many People Died So Far “It’s looking good,” said Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn. “The first blush is that not only did we dodge a bullet, but we survived pretty well. Not a lot of flooding. Tree removal, debris — don’t want to say it’s negligible, but it’s manageable.” Florida Gov. Rick Scott will head to the Keys to assess damage Monday, after the island chain was pummeled. “We are doing everything we can to get food and water throughout the state,” Scott said on Fox News Monday. “Most importantly we have got to save every life and we have got to make sure people understand it is still dangerous.” Several Caribbean islands may be in the worst shape after the storm. Barbuda received damage to 95 percent of their buildings. Puerto Rico had large swaths of people lose their power. The Leeward Islands saw food, water and medicine shortages and looting. The U.S. is sending a flight Monday to St. Martin to evacuates its citizens stuck there. As the storm moves away from Florida, massive clean up efforts will have to take place. British business magnate Richard Branson who owns a destroyed private island in the Caribbean has called for a “Marshall Plan” — like effort to aid the islands.​\n\nBefore Cassini spacecraft takes its death dive into Saturn to end its NASA mission, it took images of jets of water and organic matter rocketing out of the moon Enceladus’ south pole.",

      "answer": "Hurricane Irma caused significant economic damage in the United States, particularly in Florida, where 93% of Collier County was without power, and there was substantial damage to water and sewer infrastructure, impacting local businesses and residents' livelihoods [1]. The storm also led to lost opportunity costs in Miami Beach due to downtime and unexpected lodging expenses for residents, although major oceanfront hotels were expected to be operational shortly after the storm [2]. Nationally, the federal government prioritized lifesaving and life-sustaining efforts, with significant resources allocated to recovery and infrastructure assessment, indicating a substantial economic impact on a broader scale [3][4].",

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

          "content": "Press Briefing by PresSecretary Sarah Sanders and Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert The storm is still hitting the United States, in Georgia and South Carolina. It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

Despite the challenges in housing everyone in shelters, the proactive evacuation efforts helped reduce potential casualties and allowed for more focused rescue and recovery operations, as seen with the deployment of search-and-rescue teams and military support [2][1][3].",

There remained more than 160,000 people waiting in shelters across the state Monday. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds.

Marco Rubio said on “The Today Show.” “Not from the water.” Houston was underwater the last week of August. A water storm. Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

And soon after came the floodwaters, with water levels in Naples increasing 7 feet in just 90 minutes. As the storm's trajectory took it north, water was sucked from part of Tampa Bay, exposing a muddy expanse that would normally be underwater — a frightening portent of flooding to come when that water, and more, comes rushing back. \"MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\" appealed the National Hurricane Center after photos on social media showed people and dogs frolicking on the bay's exposed sand. The cities bracketing Tampa Bay — Tampa and St. Petersburg, with a population of some 3 million people between them — were forecast to be clobbered later Sunday by sustained hurricane-force winds. A direct hit on the area would be the first in nearly a century. \"We are about to get punched in the face by this storm,\" declared Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn. The storm's passage by no means marks the end of the danger. \"Once this system passes through, it's going to be a race to save lives and sustain lives,\" William B. \"Brock\" Long, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" With the storm on a havoc-filled trajectory, much of Florida was a jumbled tableau of overflowing shelters, boarded-up buildings and deserted streets in normally bustling urban centers.

A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge.

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now.

And soon after came the floodwaters, with water levels in Naples increasing 7 feet in just 90 minutes. As the storm's trajectory took it north, water was sucked from part of Tampa Bay, exposing a muddy expanse that would normally be underwater — a frightening portent of flooding to come when that water, and more, comes rushing back. \"MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\" appealed the National Hurricane Center after photos on social media showed people and dogs frolicking on the bay's exposed sand. The cities bracketing Tampa Bay — Tampa and St. Petersburg, with a population of some 3 million people between them — were forecast to be clobbered later Sunday by sustained hurricane-force winds. A direct hit on the area would be the first in nearly a century. \"We are about to get punched in the face by this storm,\" declared Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn. The storm's passage by no means marks the end of the danger. \"Once this system passes through, it's going to be a race to save lives and sustain lives,\" William B. \"Brock\" Long, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" With the storm on a havoc-filled trajectory, much of Florida was a jumbled tableau of overflowing shelters, boarded-up buildings and deserted streets in normally bustling urban centers.

The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Monday morning the state was “aggressively” working to get search-and-rescue teams to help with the flooding in Jacksonville and that the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York & the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were being made available for rescue operations. Scott activated all 7,000 members of the Florida National Guard, and 10,000 guardsmen from elsewhere were being deployed to the state to help with the task",

Irma’s storm surge pushed water ashore at the high tide Monday afternoon, and heavy rainfall made the flooding even worse. On Tybee Island east of Savannah, Hollard Zellers saw waist-deep water in the street as he went to fetch a kayak. About 3,000 people live on Tybee Island, which is Georgia’s largest public beach. City manager Shawn Gillen said the waters seemed to be receding quickly, but most of the island appeared to have some level of flooding and water was in many homes. Storm surge also sent floodwaters into downtown St. Marys just north of the Georgia-Florida line. St. Marys police Lt. Shannon Brock said piers and boat docks were heavily damaged and many boats sunk. 2:30 p.m. State and federal environmental regulators have issued a blanket waiver for Florida electricity companies to violate clean air and water standards for the next two weeks. The Environmental Protection Agency announced the decision in a letter issued Monday as Hurricane Irma blew through the state. The agency said the so-called No Action Assurance granted through Sept. 26 will provide Florida utility generators needed flexibility to maintain and restore electricity supplies",

South Carolina, Alabama and north central Georgia are expected to get 3 to 6 inches (7 to 15 centimeters) of rain with spots hitting 10 inches (25 centimeters). Northern Mississippi and southern Tennessee and parts of North Carolina are forecast to get 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain. 5 p.m. Officials say the 42-bridge roadway that connects the Florida Keys to each other and the mainland must be checked for safety before motorists can be allowed back onto the islands. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Monday that once officials are able to inspect, and to clear debris and sand from the Overseas Highway, it should be usable again. Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said in an email Monday afternoon that the Keys are still closed to residents and visitors as crews work to make the roads safe. Much of the Keys are still without power and water. There are 35 trucks and 100 workers heading from Jacksonville to Key West to help restore power to Keys Energy, which services the Lower Keys.

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

Rick Scott will head to the Keys to assess damage Monday, after the island chain was pummeled. “We are doing everything we can to get food and water throughout the state,” Scott said on Fox News Monday. “Most importantly we have got to save every life and we have got to make sure people understand it is still dangerous.” Several Caribbean islands may be in the worst shape after the storm. Barbuda received damage to 95 percent of their buildings. Puerto Rico had large swaths of people lose their power. The Leeward Islands saw food, water and medicine shortages and looting.

      "answer": "Hurricane Irma caused significant infrastructure damage in the United States, particularly in Florida, where power outages affected 93% of Collier County and damaged water and sewer systems [1]. The storm also led to widespread flooding in areas like Charleston, South Carolina, with tidal surges among the worst in 80 years [2]. Recovery efforts were hampered by the need to restore utilities and clear debris, impacting economic stability as businesses and tourism were disrupted, particularly in the Florida Keys and other tourist destinations [3][4].",

We are the fortunate ones.” If anything, he said, the significant damage to his city will be measured in downtime — putting up shutters, taking them down, having to incur unexpected lodging costs for residents and then cleaning up after the storm. “I think there will be the lost opportunity costs and I think it will be the damage to our residents — their livelihoods, any damage to their homes and of course to their lives,” Levine stressed. “But we’re getting back as soon as the power is restored fully. I think that Miami beach is going to be 100 percent on target.\" Levine predicted that all of the major oceanfront hotels will be fully operational by the end of the week, including the Eden Roc, which he toured with General Manager Laurence Dubey before heading to other nearby hotels.

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

Rick Scott will head to the Keys to assess damage Monday, after the island chain was pummeled. “We are doing everything we can to get food and water throughout the state,” Scott said on Fox News Monday. “Most importantly we have got to save every life and we have got to make sure people understand it is still dangerous.” Several Caribbean islands may be in the worst shape after the storm. Barbuda received damage to 95 percent of their buildings. Puerto Rico had large swaths of people lose their power. The Leeward Islands saw food, water and medicine shortages and looting. The U.S. is sending a flight Monday to St. Martin to evacuates its citizens stuck there. As the storm moves away from Florida, massive clean up efforts will have to take place.

      "answer": "Hurricane Irma caused massive power outages, affecting over 6.5 million customers in Florida alone, which represented roughly 65% of all customers in the state [1][2][3]. These outages significantly hampered emergency response and recovery efforts, as many traffic signals were non-operational, roads were obstructed, and communication was disrupted, making it difficult for public service and safety agencies to restore safe conditions [2][3]. Additionally, the lack of power in the Florida Keys and other areas delayed the reopening of infrastructure and the distribution of essential supplies [2][4].",

I think the focus truly should be on the damage that’s happening in the Keys and the damage that’s happening in Jacksonville. We are the fortunate ones.” If anything, he said, the significant damage to his city will be measured in downtime — putting up shutters, taking them down, having to incur unexpected lodging costs for residents and then cleaning up after the storm. “I think there will be the lost opportunity costs and I think it will be the damage to our residents — their livelihoods, any damage to their homes and of course to their lives,” Levine stressed. “But we’re getting back as soon as the power is restored fully. I think that Miami beach is going to be 100 percent on target.\" Levine predicted that all of the major oceanfront hotels will be fully operational by the end of the week, including the Eden Roc, which he toured with General Manager Laurence Dubey before heading to other nearby hotels. Of course Miami Beach has faced bigger challenges over the years —most recently Zika, a flood this summer and even during World War II when the then Army Air Corps commandeered oceanfront hotels to train for the invasion of Normandy. To a large extent, Levine is counting that Florida Power & Light will get his city up and running as quickly as possible",

There remained more than 160,000 people waiting in shelters across the state Monday. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Monday morning the state was “aggressively” working to get search-and-rescue teams to help with the flooding in Jacksonville and that the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York & the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were being made available for rescue operations.

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

During Hurricane Irma, the storm surge pushed water ashore, exacerbating flooding in areas like Tybee Island, Georgia, and downtown St. Marys, where piers and boat docks were heavily damaged, and many boats sank [1]. In Florida, Irma's storm surge led to significant flooding in Naples, where water levels rose 7 feet in just 90 minutes, and in Jacksonville, where the state aggressively worked on search-and-rescue operations due to the inundation [2][3].",

There remained more than 160,000 people waiting in shelters across the state Monday. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge.

Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways?

South Carolina, Alabama and north central Georgia are expected to get 3 to 6 inches (7 to 15 centimeters) of rain with spots hitting 10 inches (25 centimeters). Northern Mississippi and southern Tennessee and parts of North Carolina are forecast to get 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain. 5 p.m. Officials say the 42-bridge roadway that connects the Florida Keys to each other and the mainland must be checked for safety before motorists can be allowed back onto the islands. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Monday that once officials are able to inspect, and to clear debris and sand from the Overseas Highway, it should be usable again. Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said in an email Monday afternoon that the Keys are still closed to residents and visitors as crews work to make the roads safe. Much of the Keys are still without power and water. There are 35 trucks and 100 workers heading from Jacksonville to Key West to help restore power to Keys Energy, which services the Lower Keys. All three of the Keys' hospitals are closed, including their emergency rooms, though emergency responders and medical personel have been allowed to enter the Keys",

There remained more than 160,000 people waiting in shelters across the state Monday. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Monday morning the state was “aggressively” working to get search-and-rescue teams to help with the flooding in Jacksonville and that the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York & the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were being made available for rescue operations. Scott activated all 7,000 members of the Florida National Guard, and 10,000 guardsmen from elsewhere were being deployed to the state to help with the task",

We are the fortunate ones.” If anything, he said, the significant damage to his city will be measured in downtime — putting up shutters, taking them down, having to incur unexpected lodging costs for residents and then cleaning up after the storm. “I think there will be the lost opportunity costs and I think it will be the damage to our residents — their livelihoods, any damage to their homes and of course to their lives,” Levine stressed. “But we’re getting back as soon as the power is restored fully. I think that Miami beach is going to be 100 percent on target.\" Levine predicted that all of the major oceanfront hotels will be fully operational by the end of the week, including the Eden Roc, which he toured with General Manager Laurence Dubey before heading to other nearby hotels. Of course Miami Beach has faced bigger challenges over the years —most recently Zika, a flood this summer and even during World War II when the then Army Air Corps commandeered oceanfront hotels to train for the invasion of Normandy.

Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

It'll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress. Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys. And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took -- the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm. So I'll be able to speak to that when we take questions. And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that. And what I've been reinsured -- assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action. So that’s kind of my lesson for today. I'd like to take questions now. John. Q Tom, in the immediate aftermath of Harvey, the federal response priority was to rescue people who were trapped by the enormous flooding. In the state of Florida, what's the priority for the federal government? MR. BOSSERT: There's a number of priorities for the federal government. Right now, because the storm is still ongoing, our priority is lifesaving, life-sustaining. Jacksonville and the Keys are taking a considerable amount of our attention right now. But what you'll see in Florida and, more broadly speaking as a comparative matter, Houston and Harvey was an acutely narrow area of operations comparatively",

Rick Scott will head to the Keys to assess damage Monday, after the island chain was pummeled. “We are doing everything we can to get food and water throughout the state,” Scott said on Fox News Monday. “Most importantly we have got to save every life and we have got to make sure people understand it is still dangerous.” Several Caribbean islands may be in the worst shape after the storm. Barbuda received damage to 95 percent of their buildings. Puerto Rico had large swaths of people lose their power. The Leeward Islands saw food, water and medicine shortages and looting. The U.S. is sending a flight Monday to St. Martin to evacuates its citizens stuck there. As the storm moves away from Florida, massive clean up efforts will have to take place.

The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida: one man was found dead in his home in the Florida Keys, while another was killed after losing control of his truck in tropical-storm strength winds. A sheriff’s deputy and a corrections officer were both killed in a two-car crash in Florida’s Hardee County and another person died in a car accident near Orlando that was deemed storm-related. Irma is also responsible for the death of 38 people throughout the Caribbean. As Floridians begin to emerge from shelter and return to their storm-battered state, more than 6.5 million residents are left without power – roughly 65 percent of all customers in the state – and numerous towns and cities throughout Florida have been inundated by flood waters from the storm surge.

      "answer": "The impact of utilities damage on recovery efforts and daily life disruptions following Hurricane Irma was significant, with massive power outages affecting millions across the Southeast, including 6.2 million customers in Florida alone, representing over 59% of all power company accounts in the state [1]. In Jacksonville, 32% of JEA customers were still without power, and water distribution efforts were initiated to support affected residents [2]. The disruption of utilities not only delayed recovery efforts but also posed challenges to residents' daily lives, as seen in the widespread power outages and infrastructure damage in areas like Naples and the Florida Keys [3][1].",

Rick Scott will head to the Keys to assess damage Monday, after the island chain was pummeled. “We are doing everything we can to get food and water throughout the state,” Scott said on Fox News Monday. “Most importantly we have got to save every life and we have got to make sure people understand it is still dangerous.” Several Caribbean islands may be in the worst shape after the storm. Barbuda received damage to 95 percent of their buildings. Puerto Rico had large swaths of people lose their power. The Leeward Islands saw food, water and medicine shortages and looting.

Marco Rubio said on “The Today Show.” “Not from the water.” Houston was underwater the last week of August. A water storm. Now Florida is hit by this furious surge storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in history, as the cleanup in Houston is really only just beginning. Florida is underwater and under siege, and the shelters are filled to capacity again. The Keys got hit early Sunday morning and they were bracing themselves in Fort Myers and Naples and Tampa and St. Pete for Irma to hit them later in the day. It does seem to attack with a fury that seems like a wrath from God. So maybe the best wisdom on this doesn’t just come from science or storm chasers, but from the Bible, Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the public squares…How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?” It is a good question, now that a different kind of terror comes out of the sky, in Florida this time, Sept. 10, 2017.",

Its popular Halloween Horror Nights event will go on as scheduled Friday. Disney's water parks won't open till later this week but most other attractions are running. The Dali Museum's massive geodesic glass bubble, known as the Glass Enigma, \"is fine,\" but its \"Wish Tree,\" where visitors tie wishes written on their admission wristbands, was felled in the storm. Museum spokeswoman Kathy Greif said the museum hopes to restore the tree. Florida Keys tourism spokesman Andy Newman said travelers should postpone trips there until \"the destination is ready to receive visitors.\" He said Key West's famous \"90 Miles to Cuba\" marker is solid concrete and \"ain't going nowhere\" but cleanup and restoring utilities , communications and other services will take time. CARIBBEAN. Impact in the Caribbean varied. Widespread damage was reported in the British Virgin Islands, Barbuda, St. Martin and St. Barts, including its famed Eden Rock Hotel. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Croix was said by the Caribbean Tourism Organization to be \"getting back to business,\" but visitors were encouraged to avoid St. Thomas and St. John.
