      "question": "What specific meteorological conditions during Hurricane Matthew led to the occurrence of heavy rains in the United States, and how did these conditions contribute to the intensity and distribution of rainfall?",
      "answer": "Hurricane Matthew brought heavy rains to the United States due to several specific meteorological conditions. As the storm moved along the southeastern coast, it caused extreme flooding, particularly in the Carolinas, with areas like Fayetteville, North Carolina, receiving at least 14 inches of rain, and other regions experiencing rainfall at rates of four inches per hour [1]. The storm's path up the coast, combined with its sustained winds of about 75 mph, contributed to the heavy rainfall and flooding [2]. \n\nThe potential for significant flooding was heightened by the storm surge, which was predicted to be between 5 to 7 feet from Charleston to Cape Fear, North Carolina [3]. This surge, combined with the heavy rainfall, led to widespread flooding and impassable roads, particularly in low-lying coastal areas [3]. The storm's intensity was further exacerbated by its history of gaining strength as it moved through the Caribbean, which set the stage for the severe weather conditions experienced in the U.S. [4][1]. \n\nOverall, the combination of high rainfall rates, storm surge, and the storm's trajectory along the coast contributed to the intensity and distribution of rainfall during Hurricane Matthew [1][3].",

It turned out to be a homeless woman whose tent got washed away when Hurricane Matthew struck. The shivering woman made it to the water's edge. The woman identified herself as Valerie and said she was homeless. She said she had nine children but was unable to evacuate with them. She said she weathered the storm under a tent near an overpass that crosses the low-lying road. But then floodwaters washed it away. \"It wiped out our tent, our tarp and washed away all our blankets and clothes,\" she said. A bystander offered to assist her in finding help. 9:30 a.m. Hurricane Matthew's fury was being felt Saturday on Hilton Head Island, where power was out and the two roads onto the resort island were blocked by trees. Water swamped roads in many areas, and there was extensive damage, much of it from the island's well-known pine trees. Chandler Brunson and her fiance were among several people on the island trying to make it back home after they evacuated. Brunson tried several different ways to get to her home in an SUV, but they were all blocked. \"I think we're going to have a pine tree splitting our house,\" Brunson said",

      "question": "What specific meteorological conditions during Hurricane Matthew led to the development of strong winds in the United States, and how did these conditions manifest in the affected areas?",
      "answer": "Hurricane Matthew was characterized by its status as a major hurricane, which contributed to the development of strong winds in the United States. As the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. in over a decade, Matthew brought with it heavy rain and wind as it moved along the Atlantic coasts of Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas [1]. The storm maintained sustained winds of about 75 mph when it was approximately 40 miles east of Cape Fear, North Carolina, indicating its strength as it approached the U.S. mainland [2].\n\nThe meteorological conditions that led to these strong winds included the hurricane's path and intensity. As Matthew moved northward, it sideswiped hundreds of miles of the U.S. coastline, with its eye staying offshore, which helped to mitigate some potential damage but still resulted in significant wind impacts [3]. The storm's intensity was such that it caused widespread power outages, affecting over 1.8 million homes and businesses in the Southeast [1]. In Florida, for example, the hardest-hit utility reported nearly 1 million customers affected by the storm's winds [1].\n\nThese conditions manifested in the affected areas through the destruction of infrastructure and natural landscapes. In Florida, the Jacksonville Beach Pier suffered heavy losses, and homes in St. Augustine and Vilano Beach were severely damaged [4]. The strong winds also led to the destruction of a one-mile stretch of A1A in Flagler County, Florida [4]. As the storm continued its path, similar wind-related damage was reported in Georgia and the Carolinas, with trees flattened and signs and awnings blown down [3].",

In addition, authorities said over 100,000 customers remain without power across five states.\n\nA building and street signs are reflected in flood waters as the Tar River rises to dangerous levels in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, in Tarboro, North Carolina, on Oct. 13, 2016.

      "question": "What specific meteorological conditions during Hurricane Matthew led to the formation of storm surges along the coast of the United States, and what evidence from news reports supports this causal relationship?",
      "answer": "Hurricane Matthew's meteorological conditions that led to the formation of storm surges along the U.S. coast included its high winds and the storm's path along the coastline. The storm had sustained winds of about 75 mph as it moved along the southeastern coast, which contributed to the storm surge [1]. The Weather Channel reported a potential storm surge of 5 to 7 feet from Charleston to Cape Fear, North Carolina, indicating the significant impact of the storm's winds and pressure on water levels [2]. Additionally, the storm's trajectory, moving up the coast and making landfall near Charleston, South Carolina, exacerbated the surge conditions by pushing seawater into low-lying coastal areas [2]. This resulted in flooding in coastal communities from Savannah, Georgia, to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, as seawater washed into homes and businesses [2]. The combination of these meteorological factors—strong winds, low pressure, and the storm's coastal path—created the conditions necessary for storm surges during Hurricane Matthew.",

Rainfall of up to 15 inches is possible today near and east of Interstate 95, along with a storm surge of 5 to 7 feet from Charleston to Cape Fear, North Carolina, according to the Weather Channel. \"This has the potential for the worst flooding since Hurricane Floyd,\" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said during a Saturday morning news conference. Folks might remember Category 2 Hurricane Floyd that hit the state hard in 1999. Even though Matthew hit the states of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina quite hard as it moved up the coast and into South Carolina, the storm was responsible for some extensive flooding, downed trees and impassable roads. Part of Highway A1A near Flagler Beach,m Florida was washed away.\n\nFrom Savannah, Georgia to Myrtle Beach, the low-lying coastal cities and communities were plagued with flooding seawater washing into their homes and businesses, and as of Saturday morning, over 100 roads in South Carolina were impassible. South Carolina Governor Nicki Haley asked residents to stay in their evacuation shelters one more day until the damages could be properly assessed. The bottom line with all this doom and gloom is that it's not quite over yet, folks. There still is the very real dangers associated with storm surge and flash-flooding to be wary about.

The Lumber River in Lumberton crested 4 feet above its record level Sunday afternoon and was forecast to remain above its previous record until at least next Saturday.

Matthew killed more than 500 people in Haiti last week, plowing into the desperately poor country at 145 mph. The fearsome storm then sideswiped hundreds of miles of the U.S. coastline from Florida through Georgia and the Carolinas, its eye staying far enough offshore that the damage in many places along the coast was relatively modest, consisting mostly of flooded streets, flattened trees and blown-down signs and awnings. A shift of just 20 or 30 miles could have meant widespread devastation nearer the ocean. An estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as Matthew closed in.",

      "question": "What specific factors during the storm in the United States contributed to flooding that resulted in significant economic damage, and what evidence is there from news reports detailing the extent and nature of this damage?",
      "answer": "Several factors during Hurricane Matthew contributed to significant flooding and economic damage in the United States. One major factor was the heavy rainfall, with areas like Fayetteville, North Carolina, receiving at least 14 inches of rain, and other regions experiencing rainfall at rates of four inches per hour [1]. This intense precipitation led to severe flooding, particularly in North Carolina, where the flooding was exacerbated by heavy rains from the previous month due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Julia [2].\n\nThe storm surge also played a critical role, with predictions of a surge of 5 to 7 feet from Charleston to Cape Fear, North Carolina, which contributed to the flooding of low-lying coastal cities and communities [3]. This surge, combined with the heavy rainfall, resulted in extensive flooding, downed trees, and impassable roads [3].\n\nThe economic damage from Hurricane Matthew was substantial, with property damage estimated at $6 billion across five states: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia [4]. Insured losses on home and commercial properties were projected to be between $4 billion and $6 billion [5]. The flooding and storm surge led to blocked roads and communities being inundated, further complicating recovery efforts and contributing to the economic impact [6].\n\nIn summary, the combination of heavy rainfall, storm surge, and pre-existing saturated conditions from previous storms led to significant flooding and economic damage during Hurricane Matthew in the United States. The extent of this damage is evidenced by the high estimated costs and the widespread impact on infrastructure and communities [4][2][5][3][6].",

A shift of just 20 or 30 miles could have meant widespread devastation nearer the ocean. An estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as Matthew closed in.",

      "question": "What specific factors during the storm in the United States led to flooding that resulted in road closures, and how were these events reported in news articles?",
      "answer": "The flooding during Hurricane Matthew in the United States, which led to road closures, was primarily caused by a combination of heavy rainfall, storm surges, and pre-existing saturated conditions. In North Carolina, the storm brought significant rainfall, with reports of up to 15 inches possible near and east of Interstate 95, contributing to severe flooding [1]. This heavy rainfall was exacerbated by the remnants of Tropical Storm Julia, which had previously caused the area to receive twice its normal amount of rain in September, leaving the ground saturated and more prone to flooding [2].\n\nThe storm surge also played a critical role, with predictions of 5 to 7 feet from Charleston to Cape Fear, North Carolina, which contributed to the flooding of low-lying coastal areas [1]. This combination of factors led to numerous road closures, including major highways such as Interstate 95 and Interstate 40 in North Carolina, which were closed due to flooding [3][4]. In South Carolina, over 100 roads were reported impassable due to flooding and downed trees [1].\n\nNews articles reported these events by highlighting the extensive impact on infrastructure and the challenges faced by residents and emergency services. For instance, the North Carolina Department of Transportation reported multiple shutdowns on major highways, and the state's emergency management office noted that nearly 770,000 customers were without power due to the storm's impact [5][4]. Additionally, the flooding was described as potentially the worst since Hurricane Floyd in 1999, underscoring the severity of the situation [1].",

      "question": "What specific factors during the storm in the United States led to flooding that directly caused power outages, and how were these factors reported in news articles?",
      "answer": "The flooding during Hurricane Matthew in the United States, which directly caused power outages, was primarily due to a combination of heavy rainfall and the storm's impact on river levels. In North Carolina, the flooding was exacerbated by the fact that many areas had already received significant rainfall in September, leading to saturated ground conditions. This was partly due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Julia, which had lingered off the coast, contributing to the already high water levels [1]. \n\nThe storm itself brought torrential rains, with some areas in North Carolina receiving over 16 inches of rain, which led to widespread flooding [2]. The Lumber River in Lumberton, North Carolina, crested 4 feet above its record level, indicating the severity of the flooding [3]. This flooding was described as \"life-threatening\" and was expected to continue affecting the region for an extended period [4].\n\nThe heavy rains and subsequent flooding resulted in significant power outages. In North Carolina alone, nearly 770,000 customers were without power at one point [4]. The restoration of power was delayed due to the hazardous conditions, which made it difficult for repair crews to access affected areas [5]. Additionally, the high winds and flooding from the storm caused damage to infrastructure, further complicating efforts to restore electricity [6].\n\nOverall, the combination of pre-existing saturated conditions, heavy rainfall from the storm, and the resulting river flooding were key factors that led to the extensive power outages reported in the news articles [1][2][4].",

      "question": "What specific factors during the storm in the United States contributed to flooding that resulted in fatalities, and how were these factors reported in news articles?",
      "answer": "Several factors during Hurricane Matthew contributed to flooding in the United States, which resulted in fatalities. One significant factor was the heavy rainfall associated with the storm. For instance, Fayetteville, North Carolina, received at least 14 inches of rain, with some areas experiencing rainfall at a rate of four inches per hour [1]. Additionally, the Lumber River in Lumberton, North Carolina, crested four feet above its record level, exacerbating flooding conditions [2]. \n\nThe flooding was further intensified by prior weather conditions. In North Carolina, the flooding was worsened by heavy rains in September, which had already saturated the ground. Many areas east of Interstate 95 received at least twice their normal amount of rain in September, partly due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Julia [3]. This pre-existing saturation made the region more susceptible to flooding when Hurricane Matthew hit.\n\nThe storm's impact on infrastructure also played a role. Roads were blocked, and major highways like Interstate 95 and parts of Interstate 40 were closed due to flooding, which stranded motorists and complicated rescue efforts [4]. The closure of these critical routes hindered evacuation and emergency response operations, contributing to the fatalities [5].\n\nOverall, the combination of intense rainfall, pre-existing saturated conditions, and infrastructure challenges were key factors that led to the severe flooding and associated fatalities during Hurricane Matthew in the United States [1][2][3][5][4].",

The fearsome storm then sideswiped hundreds of miles of the U.S. coastline from Florida through Georgia and the Carolinas, its eye staying far enough offshore that the damage in many places along the coast was relatively modest, consisting mostly of flooded streets, flattened trees and blown-down signs and awnings. A shift of just 20 or 30 miles could have meant widespread devastation nearer the ocean. An estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as Matthew closed in.",

It said the motorists were near Wilson. Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation has closed stretches of Interstate 95 and parts of Interstate 40 after Hurricane Matthew drenched the state. 3:10 p.m. A third fatality related to harsh weather brought on by Hurricane Matthew has been reported in Georgia, bringing the U.S. death toll from the storm to 10. Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police said in a statement Saturday that they are investigating the death of a man at his home, possibly from structural damage caused by a fallen tree.

      "answer": "The early warning systems implemented during Hurricane Matthew in the United States included evacuation orders and hurricane warnings. An estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as the storm approached, which was a significant measure to ensure the safety of residents in the affected areas [1][2]. Additionally, hurricane warnings were in effect from Fernandina Beach in Florida to Surf City, North Carolina, urging locals to stay off the streets for their safety [3].\n\nThese early warning systems contributed to reducing fatalities by encouraging people to leave high-risk areas and avoid dangerous conditions. For instance, the evacuation orders likely prevented many potential casualties by moving people out of the path of the storm and away from areas prone to flooding and wind damage [1][2]. The warnings and orders were part of a broader effort to mitigate the impact of the hurricane, which, despite causing significant damage, resulted in fewer fatalities than might have occurred without such measures [1][2][3].",

Thousands of people found themselves suddenly trapped in homes and cars during the torrential rains over the weekend. Rescuers in Coast Guard helicopters plucked some of them from rooftops and used military vehicles to reach others. The storm killed more than 500 people in Haiti. Utility outage maps showed Monday that just under a half million electric customers across South Carolina were still in the dark. North Carolina Emergency Management reported that about 491,000 residents were without service Monday morning. The state's largest utility, Duke Energy, had the biggest problems, with about 310,000 customers without service. Power companies say it may be several days before power can be restored to all electric customers. McCrory said that the Federal Aviation Administration has placed temporary flight restrictions over Lumberton. He asked operators of drones to keep them out of the airspace over flooded areas so they do not endanger helicopter teams. He also said that \"inland flooding\" remains the greatest threat to the state. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "question": "What specific measures were taken during the evacuation process in the United States storm event, and how did these measures demonstrably reduce the number of fatalities?",
      "answer": "During the evacuation process for Hurricane Matthew in the United States, several specific measures were implemented to ensure the safety of residents and reduce fatalities. Authorities ordered an estimated 2 million people in the Southeast to evacuate their homes as the hurricane approached, which was a significant preventive measure to protect lives [1][2]. In addition, numerous evacuation shelters were established across the affected states. For instance, in North Carolina, there were 80 Red Cross and community evacuation shelters open with more than 4,000 people seeking refuge [3]. South Carolina had 61 shelters with over 4,500 people, and Georgia had 34 shelters with a similar number of evacuees [3]. These shelters provided a safe haven for those who could not remain in their homes due to the storm's impact.\n\nThe decision to evacuate was not taken lightly, as officials weighed the potential risks and benefits. In Florida, for example, the decision to call for evacuations was deemed the right one in light of the damage caused by the storm, which included power outages, flooded homes, and damaged infrastructure [4]. The establishment of shelters and the evacuation orders likely contributed to a lower number of fatalities, as they provided safe locations for people to stay during the storm's most dangerous periods.\n\nWhile the exact number of lives saved by these measures is difficult to quantify, the proactive evacuation orders and the availability of shelters undoubtedly played a crucial role in minimizing the loss of life during Hurricane Matthew. The coordinated efforts between government officials, the Red Cross, and community partners ensured that people received the help they needed quickly, which was vital in reducing the potential for fatalities [3].",

Rainfall of up to 15 inches is possible today near and east of Interstate 95, along with a storm surge of 5 to 7 feet from Charleston to Cape Fear, North Carolina, according to the Weather Channel. \"This has the potential for the worst flooding since Hurricane Floyd,\" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said during a Saturday morning news conference. Folks might remember Category 2 Hurricane Floyd that hit the state hard in 1999. Even though Matthew hit the states of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina quite hard as it moved up the coast and into South Carolina, the storm was responsible for some extensive flooding, downed trees and impassable roads. Part of Highway A1A near Flagler Beach,m Florida was washed away.\n\nFrom Savannah, Georgia to Myrtle Beach, the low-lying coastal cities and communities were plagued with flooding seawater washing into their homes and businesses, and as of Saturday morning, over 100 roads in South Carolina were impassible. South Carolina Governor Nicki Haley asked residents to stay in their evacuation shelters one more day until the damages could be properly assessed. The bottom line with all this doom and gloom is that it's not quite over yet, folks. There still is the very real dangers associated with storm surge and flash-flooding to be wary about. So stay safe and dry.",

      "question": "What specific measures of community preparedness were implemented during the storm in the United States, and how did these measures demonstrably contribute to preventing fatalities?",
      "answer": "During Hurricane Matthew, several community preparedness measures were implemented across the southeastern United States, which contributed to preventing fatalities. One significant measure was the issuance of evacuation orders. An estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as the hurricane approached, which helped reduce the number of people in harm's way [1][2]. In addition, numerous evacuation shelters were established to provide refuge for those displaced by the storm. For instance, in North Carolina, there were 80 Red Cross and community evacuation shelters open with more than 4,000 people seeking refuge [3]. Similarly, South Carolina had 61 shelters with over 4,500 people, and Florida had 72 shelters with more than 340 people [3].\n\nThe Red Cross played a crucial role in the preparedness efforts by mobilizing 133 response vehicles, setting up 3 kitchens, and providing 97 trailers filled with essential supplies such as water, ready-to-eat meals, and shelter supplies [3]. These efforts ensured that evacuees had access to necessary resources and support during the storm.\n\nFurthermore, the coordination between government officials and community partners was vital in the response efforts, ensuring that people received help quickly [3]. The preemptive evacuation orders and the establishment of shelters likely contributed to minimizing fatalities by moving people out of high-risk areas and providing them with safe havens during the storm.",

Thousands of people found themselves suddenly trapped in homes and cars during the torrential rains over the weekend. Rescuers in Coast Guard helicopters plucked some of them from rooftops and used military vehicles to reach others. The storm killed more than 500 people in Haiti.

North Carolina Emergency Management reported that about 491,000 residents were without service Monday morning. The state's largest utility, Duke Energy, had the biggest problems, with about 310,000 customers without service. Power companies say it may be several days before power can be restored to all electric customers. McCrory said that the Federal Aviation Administration has placed temporary flight restrictions over Lumberton. He asked operators of drones to keep them out of the airspace over flooded areas so they do not endanger helicopter teams. He also said that \"inland flooding\" remains the greatest threat to the state. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "answer": "Hurricane Matthew caused significant infrastructure damage and community disruption in the United States during its 2016 landfall, with an estimated $6 billion in property damage across five states, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia [1]. The storm left over 1.8 million homes and businesses without power, with severe flooding reported in areas like North Carolina, where the historic city of Princeville was completely evacuated due to being underwater [2][3]. Additionally, the storm led to the evacuation of more than 3 million coastal residents and the closure of major roads and services, such as parts of Interstate 95 and Amtrak service in the Southeast [4].",

It turned out to be a homeless woman whose tent got washed away when Hurricane Matthew struck. The shivering woman made it to the water's edge. The woman identified herself as Valerie and said she was homeless. She said she had nine children but was unable to evacuate with them. She said she weathered the storm under a tent near an overpass that crosses the low-lying road.

A bystander offered to assist her in finding help. 9:30 a.m. Hurricane Matthew's fury was being felt Saturday on Hilton Head Island, where power was out and the two roads onto the resort island were blocked by trees. Water swamped roads in many areas, and there was extensive damage, much of it from the island's well-known pine trees. Chandler Brunson and her fiance were among several people on the island trying to make it back home after they evacuated. Brunson tried several different ways to get to her home in an SUV, but they were all blocked. \"I think we're going to have a pine tree splitting our house,\" Brunson said",

Millions of people's lives were disrupted, with the evacuation of more than 3 million coastal residents; the closing of hundreds of roads including parts of Interstate 95 -- a major East Coast artery; the halting of Amtrak service in the Southeast; the cancellation of thousands of flights.\n\nNorth Carolina is one of the last states affected by Matthew and one of the hardest-hit. At least 10 deaths in the Tar Heel state have been attributed to the storm, and at least 5 people are missing, Gov. Pat McCrory said this morning.\n\nMore than 500,000 homes and businesses are without power, which the governor estimates affects more than 1 million people, or 10 percent of the state's population. McCrory said the greatest threat right now is flooding in areas away from the coast, which is expected to continue throughout the week.",

      "answer": "Community preparedness played a significant role in mitigating the effects of Hurricane Matthew, as evidenced by the coordinated efforts of the Red Cross and government agencies in providing shelters and mobilizing resources across affected states [1][2]. The preemptive evacuation orders for approximately 2 million people in the Southeast helped reduce potential casualties and facilitated a more organized response and recovery process [3][4]. Additionally, the federal emergency declarations and the involvement of the National Guard in states like Virginia and Georgia further exemplified the impact of preparedness in enhancing recovery efforts [5][6].",

Duke currently has 5,600 crew members focused on the restoring power and they’ve requested an additional 3,000 line and tree crews to help. “With the damage caused by this storm, the restoration process is going to take longer than normalbut please know that Duke Energy is out there assessing damage, and in areas they can, they’ll be restoring power as soon as possible and we won’t stop until everybody has their lights back on,” Archie said. Three-quarters of a million people in South Carolina were left without electricity, and 250,000 were in the dark in coastal Georgia. About 1 million people in Florida lost power. Although the storm is moving off the northeastern coast of North Carolina, the flooding and destruction left behind will remain for awhile, McCrory said. “This is going to be a prolonged event. We will have very serious issues.” Transportation officials are making quick progress in reopening parts of Interstate 40 after flooding brought on by the torrential rain. The North Carolina Department of Transportation reported on its website Sunday that there are now only two shutdowns on I-40. A three-mile stretch of the highway is still blocked east of Raleigh in Wake County. There’s also a three-mile shutdown of I-40 east of Benson in Johnston County",

It'll free up federal aid to help recovery efforts in counties including Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Glynn, Liberty and McIntosh. The Federal Emergency Management Agency says damage survey is still continuing. Obama signed an emergency declaration Thursday for Georgia after Gov. Nathan Deal requested the federal designation. The declaration allowed federal agencies to coordinate disaster relief efforts and use federal aid to assist people dealing with the storm. It's designated to 30 counties in coastal Georgia. 10 a.m. The governor of Georgia is expecting to survey storm-struck areas along the coastal region of the state. Gov. Nathan Deal will visit Brunswick and Savannah on Sunday afternoon. He wants to assess damage in those areas for recovery after the powerful winds of Hurricane Matthew raked through Georgia's 100-mile coastline overnight Friday. Georgia Power says about 200,000 homes and businesses on the coast are still without electricity. The bulk of the outages remain in Chatham County, which has more than 111,000. Some homes suffered roof damage but otherwise appeared undamaged, even on the beach where windows without boards protecting them were unbroken. There were three fatalities related to the harsh weather brought on by the storm. Two deaths occurred in Bulloch County. The other in Chatham. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "answer": "Early warning systems in the United States have been effective in mitigating the impact of storms by facilitating large-scale evacuations, as evidenced by the estimated 2 million people ordered to evacuate ahead of Hurricane Matthew [1][2]. These systems have influenced response and recovery efforts by enabling pre-positioning of resources, such as the Virginia National Guard's deployment of personnel and equipment to support affected areas [3].",

      "answer": "Evacuation strategies during Hurricane Matthew led to the evacuation of over 3 million coastal residents, which likely mitigated the potential for higher casualties, as evidenced by the relatively modest damage along many parts of the U.S. coastline despite the storm's severity [1][2]. However, some residents expressed frustration with the evacuation orders, feeling they were unnecessary after finding their homes unscathed, indicating a mixed perception of the evacuation's effectiveness [3].",

It turned out to be a homeless woman whose tent got washed away when Hurricane Matthew struck. The shivering woman made it to the water's edge. The woman identified herself as Valerie and said she was homeless. She said she had nine children but was unable to evacuate with them. She said she weathered the storm under a tent near an overpass that crosses the low-lying road. But then floodwaters washed it away. \"It wiped out our tent, our tarp and washed away all our blankets and clothes,\" she said. A bystander offered to assist her in finding help. 9:30 a.m. Hurricane Matthew's fury was being felt Saturday on Hilton Head Island, where power was out and the two roads onto the resort island were blocked by trees. Water swamped roads in many areas, and there was extensive damage, much of it from the island's well-known pine trees. Chandler Brunson and her fiance were among several people on the island trying to make it back home after they evacuated. Brunson tried several different ways to get to her home in an SUV, but they were all blocked. \"I think we're going to have a pine tree splitting our house,\" Brunson said",

North Carolina has averaged about three fatalities per day this week, officials said, the latest two of which involved a driver in Wayne County and a 51-year-old man who was talking in Johnston County on Sunday and got swept up by waters. His body was recovered in the past 24 hours, officials said. Gov. Pat McCrory said an additional three counties have been added to the federal disaster declaration that will help local and state governments augment the costs of responding to the disaster and pay for storm debris removal. To date, about 35 counties have been included. The National Weather Service reported 18.38 inches of rain in Elizabethtown in southeastern North Carolina, and 14 to 16 inches were dumped in other areas of the coastal Carolinas. The Sandhills region, which was still recovering from flooding rains a week earlier, was among the hardest hit areas of the state.",

      "answer": "Flooding during Hurricane Matthew significantly contributed to the overall damage and response efforts in the United States, with severe flooding reported in North Carolina and South Carolina, exacerbated by heavy rains in September prior to the storm [1][2]. The flooding led to widespread power outages, with nearly 1.8 million homes and businesses losing electricity, and caused numerous road closures, complicating rescue and recovery operations [3][4]. The storm's impact was further intensified by storm surges and flash flooding, which posed ongoing threats even after the hurricane had moved offshore [5][4].",

Part of Highway A1A near Flagler Beach,m Florida was washed away.\n\nFrom Savannah, Georgia to Myrtle Beach, the low-lying coastal cities and communities were plagued with flooding seawater washing into their homes and businesses, and as of Saturday morning, over 100 roads in South Carolina were impassible. South Carolina Governor Nicki Haley asked residents to stay in their evacuation shelters one more day until the damages could be properly assessed. The bottom line with all this doom and gloom is that it's not quite over yet, folks. There still is the very real dangers associated with storm surge and flash-flooding to be wary about. So stay safe and dry.",

Authorities in coastal Georgia and South Carolina warned residents it may take days or even weeks to restore electricity and clean up all the debris left behind by the winds and ocean flooding. Matthew killed more than 500 people in Haiti last week, plowing into the desperately poor country at 145 mph. The fearsome storm then sideswiped hundreds of miles of the U.S. coastline from Florida through Georgia and the Carolinas, its eye staying far enough offshore that the damage in many places along the coast was relatively modest, consisting mostly of flooded streets, flattened trees and blown-down signs and awnings. A shift of just 20 or 30 miles could have meant widespread devastation nearer the ocean. An estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as Matthew closed in.",

McCrory said that the Federal Aviation Administration has placed temporary flight restrictions over Lumberton. He asked operators of drones to keep them out of the airspace over flooded areas so they do not endanger helicopter teams. He also said that \"inland flooding\" remains the greatest threat to the state. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

One 66-year-old man near Columbia, South Carolina, died at a nursing facility when he got pinned under his electric wheelchair in water. Nearly 1 million homes and businesses still did not have power Monday morning in North Carolina and South Carolina. Authorities in coastal Georgia and South Carolina warned residents it may take days or even weeks to restore electricity and clean up all the debris left behind by the winds and ocean flooding. Matthew killed more than 500 people in Haiti last week, plowing into the desperately poor country at 145 mph. The fearsome storm then sideswiped hundreds of miles of the U.S. coastline from Florida through Georgia and the Carolinas, its eye staying far enough offshore that the damage in many places along the coast was relatively modest, consisting mostly of flooded streets, flattened trees and blown-down signs and awnings.

Duke currently has 5,600 crew members focused on the restoring power and they’ve requested an additional 3,000 line and tree crews to help. “With the damage caused by this storm, the restoration process is going to take longer than normalbut please know that Duke Energy is out there assessing damage, and in areas they can, they’ll be restoring power as soon as possible and we won’t stop until everybody has their lights back on,” Archie said. Three-quarters of a million people in South Carolina were left without electricity, and 250,000 were in the dark in coastal Georgia. About 1 million people in Florida lost power. Although the storm is moving off the northeastern coast of North Carolina, the flooding and destruction left behind will remain for awhile, McCrory said. “This is going to be a prolonged event. We will have very serious issues.” Transportation officials are making quick progress in reopening parts of Interstate 40 after flooding brought on by the torrential rain. The North Carolina Department of Transportation reported on its website Sunday that there are now only two shutdowns on I-40. A three-mile stretch of the highway is still blocked east of Raleigh in Wake County. There’s also a three-mile shutdown of I-40 east of Benson in Johnston County",

Thousands of people found themselves suddenly trapped in homes and cars during the torrential rains over the weekend. Rescuers in Coast Guard helicopters plucked some of them from rooftops and used military vehicles to reach others. The storm killed more than 500 people in Haiti. Utility outage maps showed Monday that just under a half million electric customers across South Carolina were still in the dark. North Carolina Emergency Management reported that about 491,000 residents were without service Monday morning. The state's largest utility, Duke Energy, had the biggest problems, with about 310,000 customers without service. Power companies say it may be several days before power can be restored to all electric customers. McCrory said that the Federal Aviation Administration has placed temporary flight restrictions over Lumberton. He asked operators of drones to keep them out of the airspace over flooded areas so they do not endanger helicopter teams. He also said that \"inland flooding\" remains the greatest threat to the state. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "answer": "Strong infrastructure plays a crucial role in mitigating the impact of storms by facilitating quicker recovery efforts and reducing the extent of damage. For instance, despite the extensive power outages caused by Hurricane Matthew, utility companies like Duke Energy were able to mobilize thousands of crew members to restore power, highlighting the importance of having a robust and responsive infrastructure system in place [1][2]. Additionally, the reopening of major highways such as Interstate 40 in North Carolina after flooding demonstrates how resilient infrastructure can expedite recovery and aid in the return to normalcy [1].",

The advisory said that \"life-threatening flooding\" would continue in North Carolina and that the Mid-Atlantic coast would see high water levels and storm surges. \"We are looking at very significant flooding.

Rainfall of up to 15 inches is possible today near and east of Interstate 95, along with a storm surge of 5 to 7 feet from Charleston to Cape Fear, North Carolina, according to the Weather Channel. \"This has the potential for the worst flooding since Hurricane Floyd,\" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said during a Saturday morning news conference. Folks might remember Category 2 Hurricane Floyd that hit the state hard in 1999. Even though Matthew hit the states of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina quite hard as it moved up the coast and into South Carolina, the storm was responsible for some extensive flooding, downed trees and impassable roads. Part of Highway A1A near Flagler Beach,m Florida was washed away.\n\nFrom Savannah, Georgia to Myrtle Beach, the low-lying coastal cities and communities were plagued with flooding seawater washing into their homes and businesses, and as of Saturday morning, over 100 roads in South Carolina were impassible. South Carolina Governor Nicki Haley asked residents to stay in their evacuation shelters one more day until the damages could be properly assessed. The bottom line with all this doom and gloom is that it's not quite over yet, folks. There still is the very real dangers associated with storm surge and flash-flooding to be wary about.

It'll free up federal aid to help recovery efforts in counties including Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Glynn, Liberty and McIntosh. The Federal Emergency Management Agency says damage survey is still continuing. Obama signed an emergency declaration Thursday for Georgia after Gov. Nathan Deal requested the federal designation. The declaration allowed federal agencies to coordinate disaster relief efforts and use federal aid to assist people dealing with the storm. It's designated to 30 counties in coastal Georgia. 10 a.m. The governor of Georgia is expecting to survey storm-struck areas along the coastal region of the state. Gov. Nathan Deal will visit Brunswick and Savannah on Sunday afternoon. He wants to assess damage in those areas for recovery after the powerful winds of Hurricane Matthew raked through Georgia's 100-mile coastline overnight Friday. Georgia Power says about 200,000 homes and businesses on the coast are still without electricity. The bulk of the outages remain in Chatham County, which has more than 111,000. Some homes suffered roof damage but otherwise appeared undamaged, even on the beach where windows without boards protecting them were unbroken. There were three fatalities related to the harsh weather brought on by the storm. Two deaths occurred in Bulloch County. The other in Chatham. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "answer": "Hurricane Matthew's strong winds contributed to widespread damage and disruption in the United States by flattening trees, blowing down signs and awnings, and causing power outages for over 1.8 million homes and businesses across Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas [1][2]. The winds, combined with heavy rain, led to blocked roads and communities being flooded, further complicating rescue and recovery efforts [3].",

Duke currently has 5,600 crew members focused on the restoring power and they’ve requested an additional 3,000 line and tree crews to help. “With the damage caused by this storm, the restoration process is going to take longer than normalbut please know that Duke Energy is out there assessing damage, and in areas they can, they’ll be restoring power as soon as possible and we won’t stop until everybody has their lights back on,” Archie said. Three-quarters of a million people in South Carolina were left without electricity, and 250,000 were in the dark in coastal Georgia. About 1 million people in Florida lost power. Although the storm is moving off the northeastern coast of North Carolina, the flooding and destruction left behind will remain for awhile, McCrory said. “This is going to be a prolonged event. We will have very serious issues.” Transportation officials are making quick progress in reopening parts of Interstate 40 after flooding brought on by the torrential rain. The North Carolina Department of Transportation reported on its website Sunday that there are now only two shutdowns on I-40. A three-mile stretch of the highway is still blocked east of Raleigh in Wake County. There’s also a three-mile shutdown of I-40 east of Benson in Johnston County",
