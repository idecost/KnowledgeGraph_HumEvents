Vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities, isolated women, and older individuals, were at high risk due to limited access to information and shelter. The economic damage and fatalities are unknown, but the infrastructure and communities in the affected areas were severely impacted.\n\n- **Likelihood of multi-hazard risks:** High likelihood of subsequent flooding and potential landslides due to the heavy rainfall and the region's terrain.\n\n- **Best practices for managing this risk:** Effective strategies include pre-storm preparation such as securing property, ensuring clear communication channels for warnings, and establishing evacuation plans. Post-storm, rapid assessment and deployment of aid, along with community-based recovery efforts, are crucial.\n\n- **Recommendations and supportive measures for recovery:** Immediate recommendations include providing humanitarian aid, focusing on the most vulnerable populations, and ensuring access to clean water and medical care. Long-term recovery should involve rebuilding infrastructure with resilience in mind, improving early warning systems, and enhancing community preparedness and education on disaster risk reduction.",

The storm passed over Haiti, particularly affecting the northeast and northwest regions, including the coastline, which were severely impacted by the amount of water falling, predicting flooding both on the coast and inland [1]. The absence of natural obstacles such as trees in northern Haiti, which typically provide a buffer against heavy rainfall, further exacerbated the flooding situation [2]. These conditions contributed to the severity of the storm's impact by causing significant flooding in areas like Fort-Liberté, as evidenced by the flooding of the Romeo Baptist church and other locations in the region [3]. The combination of high wind speeds, heavy rainfall, and the lack of natural barriers led to severe flooding and increased the overall impact of the storm on the affected regions in Haiti [2][1][3].",

      "answer": "The evidence that heavy rainfall directly led to flooding in the affected areas of Haiti during Hurricane Irma is supported by both meteorological data and eyewitness accounts. According to Source 2, Hurricane Irma, classified as a Category 5 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, passed over Haiti, severely affecting the north-east and north-west regions, particularly the coastline. The report specifically mentions that the amount of water falling predicted flooding both on the coast and inland, indicating that heavy rainfall was a significant factor in the flooding experienced in these areas [1].\n\nAdditionally, eyewitness accounts from Source 3 provide visual evidence of the flooding caused by the heavy rainfall. Photos from Fort-Liberté, northeast Haiti, show the Romeo Baptist church and streets in the Malfety district partially flooded, as well as floodwaters at a wall bordering the Catholic Diocesan Assembly, all of which occurred on September 8, 2017, following the landfall of Hurricane Irma [2]. These images corroborate the reports of heavy rainfall leading to flooding in the affected regions.",

      "answer": "During Hurricane Irma in Haiti, several specific factors contributed to flooding, which increased the risk for vulnerable populations. The absence of natural obstacles such as trees in northern Haiti, which typically provide a buffer against heavy rainfall, was a significant factor leading to severe flooding in the region [1]. Additionally, the heavy rainfall predicted to fall on the coast and inland areas exacerbated the flooding situation [2]. \n\nThe most affected areas included the northeast and northwest regions, particularly the coastline, with places like Port-de-Paix, Jean Rabel, and the Ouanaminthe area on the border with the Dominican Republic experiencing severe impacts [2]. In Fort-Liberté, northeast Haiti, floodwaters were observed in various locations, including the Romeo Baptist church and streets in the Malfety district, indicating widespread flooding [3].\n\nThese conditions posed a heightened risk to vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities, isolated women, and older individuals living in remote or difficult-to-access areas. These groups were particularly at risk because emergency services would be unable to reach them in the days immediately following the hurricane [1]. The flooding and isolation made it challenging for these populations to access necessary information and shelter, further increasing their vulnerability during the disaster [1].",

The sources primarily discuss the concerns and preparations made by organizations like Handicap International and ACTED, as well as the impact of the hurricane, but they do not provide detailed accounts of evacuation plans or their effectiveness in reducing risks for vulnerable groups [1][2][3].",

      "answer": "The rapid assessment conducted during Hurricane Irma in Haiti highlighted several critical actions and findings aimed at mitigating extended community impact. Local radio stations played a crucial role by advising residents to take preventive measures such as cutting tree branches near their homes, wrapping important documents in plastic, and staying together to avoid isolation [1]. These advisories were part of a broader effort to prepare the population for the hurricane's impact.\n\nHandicap International expressed significant concern for vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities, isolated women, and older individuals living in hard-to-reach areas. The organization planned to assess the situation in collaboration with other humanitarian aid organizations and Haitian authorities once the alert was lifted. They also considered implementing a logistics support operation to facilitate the storage and transport of humanitarian aid to affected areas [1].\n\nACTED, another organization involved in the emergency response, had teams ready to deploy in the north of the country to assess needs. This rapid mobilization was crucial in addressing the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, particularly in areas like Port-de-Paix, Jean Rabel, and Ouanaminthe, which were severely affected [2]. The presence of disaster services teams in Fort-Liberté, as seen in photos, indicates that local authorities were actively coordinating response efforts to manage the situation [3].\n\nThese combined efforts, including preemptive advisories, rapid assessments, and coordinated humanitarian responses, were instrumental in preventing a more extended impact on the communities affected by Hurricane Irma in Haiti.",

      "answer": "During Hurricane Irma in Haiti, humanitarian aid organizations took several actions to mitigate the storm's impact on communities. Handicap International was particularly concerned about the most vulnerable populations, such as people with disabilities, isolated women, and older individuals living in hard-to-reach areas. They prepared to assess the situation and potentially implement logistics support operations to supply humanitarian aid, including organizing the storage and transport of goods to affected areas [1]. This proactive planning aimed to ensure that aid could be delivered efficiently once the immediate danger had passed.\n\nACTED, another humanitarian organization, mobilized teams to assess needs in the north of the country, which was severely affected by the hurricane. They were ready to deploy to the most impacted areas, such as Port-de-Paix, Jean Rabel, and Ouanaminthe, to evaluate the situation and respond accordingly [2]. This readiness to assess and respond quickly was crucial in preventing extended community impact by ensuring that aid could be directed where it was most needed.\n\nThese actions, as reported, highlight the importance of preparedness and rapid response in disaster situations. By organizing logistics and mobilizing assessment teams, these organizations aimed to minimize the hurricane's long-term effects on the communities in Haiti.",

The storm severely impacted the north-east and north-west regions, with predictions of coastal and inland flooding due to the heavy rainfall [2]. The lack of natural barriers in northern Haiti exacerbated the flooding, posing a severe threat to isolated communities and vulnerable populations [3].",

This situation necessitates a robust logistics support operation to deliver humanitarian aid, which is crucial for long-term recovery and resilience planning, as the country is still recovering from previous disasters like Hurricane Matthew and ongoing challenges such as a cholera epidemic [1][2].",

In addition, the terrain of northern Haiti, particularly the absence of natural obstacles such as trees, which usually provide a buffer against heavy rainfall, suggests that this part of the island will experience severe flooding. A large number of people live in isolated areas without easy access to information, or are unable to take shelter. Handicap International is particularly worried about the most vulnerable individuals - people with disabilities, isolated women, and older people, living in isolated or difficult-to-access areas, which emergency services will be unable to reach in the days immediately following the passage of the hurricane.

The storm severely impacted the northeast and northwest regions, including Port-de-Paix and Gonaives, causing significant flooding and further straining the already limited resources available for disaster response [2][3].",

      "answer": "Humanitarian aid efforts in Haiti following Hurricane Irma were challenged by the severe impact on the northeast and northwest regions, with significant flooding predicted along the coast and inland areas, complicating immediate relief efforts [1]. Handicap International expressed concern that existing resources were insufficient to meet the needs of the most vulnerable populations, such as people with disabilities and those in isolated areas, indicating a gap in immediate aid effectiveness [2]. Despite these challenges, organizations like ACTED mobilized teams to assess needs and provide emergency response, although the long-term recovery was further complicated by pre-existing issues from previous disasters like Hurricane Matthew and ongoing socio-economic challenges [1].",

Handicap International’s teams are preparing to travel to the north of Haiti as soon as the alert is lifted, to assess the situation in conjunction with other humanitarian aid organisations and the Haitian authorities. Our current information suggests that the means already in place would fall far short of what is needed to help victims of the disaster. In addition, the terrain of northern Haiti, particularly the absence of natural obstacles such as trees, which usually provide a buffer against heavy rainfall, suggests that this part of the island will experience severe flooding. A large number of people live in isolated areas without easy access to information, or are unable to take shelter. Handicap International is particularly worried about the most vulnerable individuals - people with disabilities, isolated women, and older people, living in isolated or difficult-to-access areas, which emergency services will be unable to reach in the days immediately following the passage of the hurricane.
