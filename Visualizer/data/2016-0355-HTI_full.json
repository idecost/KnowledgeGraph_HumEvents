But the toll from the storm could be enormous, she said. In Canaan, a flood-prone area where the agency works, more than 50% of the population living there lost homes in the earthquake, Pearl said. \"Many are still living in temporary shelters. Nationwide, some 60,000 are still living in displacement camps from the earthquake.\" And she says there is renewed concern about cholera. \"The Haitian people are still rebuilding their lives.

The southern coast of the country is currently on hurricane alert status. Winds of up to 200 km/h, heavy rainfall and significant material damages are expected. While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur. ACTED teams are mobilized in southern Haiti to launch emergency operations according to the needs. ACTED teams are pre-positioned in the South and Grand’Anse regions",

We must sleep on the floor ...

The storm is expected to make a direct hit later on Tuesday in the province of Guantanamo, the disputed home to a U.S. Naval base and military prison but also a small Cuban city. \"We are receiving people living in villages prone to flooding,\" said Alexis Iglesias, head of the evacuation committee at Guantanamo University which was being used as shelter. \"Food is guaranteed and we have a generator that will guarantee that the kitchen keeps on working in case of a power cut,\" he said, at the shelter, where some 400 people were staying. The U.S. Agency for International Development said on Monday it was providing a combined $400,000 in aid to Haiti and Jamaica.

Both deaths were in small fishing towns, near the southwestern coastal city of Les Cayes. Pearl says Mercy Corp volunteers already on the ground will assess the damage and begin to organize a response once the brunt of the storm has passed. But the toll from the storm could be enormous, she said. In Canaan, a flood-prone area where the agency works, more than 50% of the population living there lost homes in the earthquake, Pearl said. \"Many are still living in temporary shelters. Nationwide, some 60,000 are still living in displacement camps from the earthquake.\" And she says there is renewed concern about cholera. \"The Haitian people are still rebuilding their lives. It's a huge setback for all the work that's been taking place,\" Pearl said. Follow Miller on Twitter @susmiller.",

Marie Alta Jean-Baptiste, the director of the country's Civil Protection Agency, told the Associated Press that two fishermen died in turbulent waters from the approaching storm. Both deaths were in small fishing towns, near the southwestern coastal city of Les Cayes. Pearl says Mercy Corp volunteers already on the ground will assess the damage and begin to organize a response once the brunt of the storm has passed. But the toll from the storm could be enormous, she said. In Canaan, a flood-prone area where the agency works, more than 50% of the population living there lost homes in the earthquake, Pearl said. \"Many are still living in temporary shelters. Nationwide, some 60,000 are still living in displacement camps from the earthquake.\" And she says there is renewed concern about cholera. \"The Haitian people are still rebuilding their lives. It's a huge setback for all the work that's been taking place,\" Pearl said. Follow Miller on Twitter @susmiller.",

The southern coast of the country is currently on hurricane alert status. Winds of up to 200 km/h, heavy rainfall and significant material damages are expected. While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur. ACTED teams are mobilized in southern Haiti to launch emergency operations according to the needs. ACTED teams are pre-positioned in the South and Grand’Anse regions",

According to reports, part of the seaport city of Les Cayes was underwater due to recent rains, which were also blamed for causing mudslides. Marie-Alta Jean-Baptiste, director of Haiti's civil protection, confirmed that a landslide occurred between Les Cayes and Tiburon in Haiti's Sud department [1].\n\nThe contributing factors that facilitated this causal relationship include the heavy rainfall associated with the hurricane, which caused significant flooding. Additionally, Haiti's geographical and environmental conditions exacerbated the situation. The country is characterized by high mountains and a lack of trees and bushes in areas where they have been cut for fuel, making erosion particularly dangerous [1]. This deforestation and the resulting soil instability likely contributed to the landslides following the flooding.",

Marie Alta Jean-Baptiste, the director of the country's Civil Protection Agency, told the Associated Press that two fishermen died in turbulent waters from the approaching storm. Both deaths were in small fishing towns, near the southwestern coastal city of Les Cayes. Pearl says Mercy Corp volunteers already on the ground will assess the damage and begin to organize a response once the brunt of the storm has passed. But the toll from the storm could be enormous, she said. In Canaan, a flood-prone area where the agency works, more than 50% of the population living there lost homes in the earthquake, Pearl said. \"Many are still living in temporary shelters. Nationwide, some 60,000 are still living in displacement camps from the earthquake.\" And she says there is renewed concern about cholera. \"The Haitian people are still rebuilding their lives.

The southern coast of the country is currently on hurricane alert status. Winds of up to 200 km/h, heavy rainfall and significant material damages are expected. While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur. ACTED teams are mobilized in southern Haiti to launch emergency operations according to the needs. ACTED teams are pre-positioned in the South and Grand’Anse regions",

October 4, 2016 “We have gusts of wind hitting the whole area and the people have fled to a shelter,” said Les Anglais mayor Jean-Claude Despierre. In Tiburon, another town nearby, the mayor said people who had been reluctant to leave their homes also ran for cover when the sea rose. “Everyone is trying to find a safe place to protect themselves, the situation is very difficult,” mayor Remiza Denize said, describing large waves hitting the town. Poor Haiti ans are often loath to leave home in the face of storms, fearing their few belongings will be stolen.

On the north coast, about 300 detainees were transferred from their prison near the sea in the town of Jeremie, the interior ministry said. The cyclone comes at a bad time for Haiti , where tens of thousands of people still live in tents after a 2010 earthquake that killed upwards of 200,000 people.

      "answer": "The flooding in Haiti during Hurricane Matthew was primarily caused by heavy rainfall and the overflow of water bodies, which were exacerbated by pre-existing conditions such as blocked canals and deforestation. In Port-au-Prince, workers attempted to clear canals that had been blocked by trash for months, but they were unlikely to complete the task in time to prevent flooding [1]. The seaport city of Les Cayes was particularly affected, with parts of it underwater due to recent rains, which also led to mudslides [1]. The lack of vegetation, due to deforestation for fuel, increased the risk of erosion and landslides, further contributing to the flooding [1].\n\nThe flooding and subsequent displacement were documented in various news reports. For instance, in Les Cayes, about 150 people sought refuge in a school, which served as the town's largest shelter, despite the lack of electricity and food [2]. Additionally, the mayor of Les Anglais reported that people fled to shelters as the sea rose, indicating the immediate threat of flooding [3]. The displacement was also linked to the broader vulnerability of the population, with many still living in temporary shelters or tents following the 2010 earthquake, making them particularly susceptible to the storm's impacts [4][3].",

While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur.

      "question": "What specific factors during the storm in Haiti contributed to flooding that increased the risk of cholera, and what evidence is there of this causal relationship in news reports?",
      "answer": "The flooding in Haiti during Hurricane Matthew was exacerbated by several specific factors, which in turn increased the risk of cholera outbreaks. One major factor was the heavy rainfall and strong winds associated with the hurricane, which led to significant flooding in various regions, including the South and Grand’Anse areas, known for their cholera vulnerability [1][2]. The flooding was severe enough to submerge parts of the seaport city of Les Cayes and cause mudslides, further complicating the situation [2].\n\nThe risk of cholera was heightened due to the existing presence of the disease in these regions and the potential for new outbreaks triggered by the flooding. The heavy rains and floods were likely to provoke new cholera outbreaks, as these conditions can lead to the contamination of water sources, which is a primary transmission route for cholera [1]. Additionally, the lack of adequate sanitation infrastructure and the displacement of populations into crowded shelters without proper facilities further increased the risk of cholera spreading [3].\n\nNews reports highlighted the concern for cholera outbreaks, noting that the areas most affected by the hurricane were already dealing with residual cases of the disease. The potential for exacerbation of the cholera situation was a significant concern for humanitarian organizations like ACTED, which were actively working on cholera prevention and sanitation improvements in the affected regions [1].",

In Tiburon, another town nearby, the mayor said people who had been reluctant to leave their homes also ran for cover when the sea rose. “Everyone is trying to find a safe place to protect themselves, the situation is very difficult,” mayor Remiza Denize said, describing large waves hitting the town. Poor Haiti ans are often loath to leave home in the face of storms, fearing their few belongings will be stolen.

While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur.

      "answer": "Specific instances of lack of preparedness that contributed to infrastructure damage during Hurricane Matthew in Haiti include the following:\n\n1. **Blocked Canals in Port-au-Prince**: Workers were using heavy machinery to clear canals in central Port-au-Prince that had been blocked by trash for months. However, they were unlikely to complete the task in time to prevent flooding, which contributed to infrastructure damage during the storm [1].\n\n2. **Unawareness Among Residents**: Many Haitians appeared unaware of the impending hurricane, which hindered their ability to prepare adequately. For example, a farmer named Jean-Bernard Mede expressed surprise about the storm, indicating a lack of communication and awareness efforts [2].\n\n3. **Fragile Housing and Displacement Camps**: Haiti's infrastructure was already vulnerable due to the large number of people living in fragile housing and displacement camps following the 2010 earthquake. This pre-existing condition made the infrastructure more susceptible to damage from the hurricane [3][1].\n\n4. **Inadequate Shelter Conditions**: In Les Cayes, about 150 people were sheltering in a school without electricity or food, highlighting the lack of adequate emergency shelter provisions. This situation contrasted with better-prepared shelters in neighboring Cuba, where food and power supplies were secured [4].\n\nThese instances were reported in various news articles, emphasizing the challenges faced by Haiti in preparing for and responding to the hurricane's impact.",

Poor Haiti ans are often loath to leave home in the face of storms, fearing their few belongings will be stolen.

      "question": "What specific factors related to the lack of resilience contributed to the infrastructure damage during the storm in Haiti, and how were these factors reported in news articles covering the event?",
      "answer": "The infrastructure damage in Haiti during Hurricane Matthew was exacerbated by several factors related to the country's lack of resilience. One significant factor was the pre-existing vulnerability of the population and infrastructure. Many Haitians were still living in temporary shelters or displacement camps from the 2010 earthquake, with about 60,000 people in such conditions nationwide [1][2]. This lack of permanent, resilient housing made the population particularly susceptible to the storm's impacts.\n\nAdditionally, the country's infrastructure was unprepared to withstand the powerful winds and heavy rainfall associated with a Category 4 hurricane like Matthew, which had winds of up to 200 km/h [3]. The southern coast of Haiti, which was on hurricane alert, was expected to face significant material damages due to these conditions [3]. The lack of preparedness was further highlighted by the fact that many canals in Port-au-Prince were blocked by trash, which contributed to flooding in 11 communes [2].\n\nErosion also posed a significant risk due to the high mountains and deforestation in areas where trees and bushes had been cut for fuel, increasing the danger of landslides [2]. This environmental degradation, combined with the fragile housing situation, left the population highly vulnerable to the storm's effects.\n\nMoreover, the lack of awareness and preparedness among the population was evident, as many Haitians appeared unaware of the impending hurricane, despite efforts by civil protection officials to warn residents and urge them to secure their homes and prepare emergency kits [4]. This lack of awareness and preparation further contributed to the infrastructure damage and the overall impact of the storm.",

The southern coast of the country is currently on hurricane alert status. Winds of up to 200 km/h, heavy rainfall and significant material damages are expected. While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur. ACTED teams are mobilized in southern Haiti to launch emergency operations according to the needs. ACTED teams are pre-positioned in the South and Grand’Anse regions",

In Les Cayes, part of the city was underwater due to heavy rains, which also caused mudslides in the area [1]. The flooding and mudslides in Les Cayes and Tiburon were significant enough to force residents to flee to shelters [2]. Additionally, in Les Anglais, large waves and rising sea levels prompted residents to seek shelter, as reported by the local mayor [2]. The storm's impact was exacerbated by the fragile housing conditions in Haiti, where many people were still living in temporary shelters following the 2010 earthquake [3][1]. These conditions, combined with the powerful winds and heavy rainfall from the hurricane, led to widespread displacement and the need for emergency shelter [4].",

While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur.

      "answer": "The specific instances of infrastructure damage during Hurricane Matthew in Haiti that directly led to fatalities are not explicitly detailed in the provided sources. However, the sources do describe conditions that could have contributed to fatalities. For example, the storm caused significant flooding and mudslides, which are known to be deadly in such situations. Part of the seaport city of Les Cayes was underwater due to recent rains, which also led to mudslides [1]. Additionally, the hurricane caused overnight flooding in 11 communes, and a landslide was recorded between Les Cayes and Tiburon in Haiti's Sud department [1]. These conditions, combined with the fragile housing situation in Haiti, where many people were still living in temporary shelters or tents after the 2010 earthquake, likely exacerbated the risk of fatalities [2][1].\n\nFurthermore, the lack of adequate shelter and the reluctance of some residents to leave their homes due to fear of theft of their belongings could have increased the risk of fatalities during the storm [3]. The infrastructure damage, such as blocked canals in Port-au-Prince, which workers were unable to clear in time, likely contributed to the flooding and its associated dangers [1]. While these reports highlight the severe impact of the storm on infrastructure and living conditions, they do not provide direct evidence linking specific infrastructure failures to individual fatalities.",

While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur. ACTED teams are mobilized in southern Haiti to launch emergency operations according to the needs. ACTED teams are pre-positioned in the South and Grand’Anse regions",

      "answer": "Several specific factors during Hurricane Matthew contributed to flooding in Haiti, which resulted in fatalities. One major factor was the heavy rainfall associated with the hurricane, which led to significant flooding in various regions. The seaport city of Les Cayes, for instance, was reported to be underwater due to the deluge of rain, which also caused mudslides in the area [1]. Additionally, the storm caused overnight flooding in 11 communes, exacerbating the situation [1].\n\nAnother contributing factor was the pre-existing condition of the infrastructure. Many canals in central Port-au-Prince were blocked by trash, which hindered proper drainage and increased the risk of flooding [1]. The lack of adequate infrastructure to manage such heavy rainfall and the blocked canals likely worsened the flooding situation.\n\nFurthermore, the geographical and environmental conditions in Haiti, such as high mountains and deforestation, made the region particularly susceptible to erosion and landslides, which are common consequences of heavy rainfall and can lead to further flooding [1]. The deforestation, where trees and bushes have been cut for fuel, left the land more vulnerable to erosion during the storm [1].\n\nThese factors were reported in news articles, highlighting the severe impact of the hurricane and the challenges faced by the Haitian population in dealing with the aftermath of the storm [1].",

      "answer": "During Hurricane Matthew in Haiti, several factors contributed to an increased risk of cholera, which subsequently led to health issues in the affected population. The heavy rains and floods associated with the hurricane were likely to provoke new cholera outbreaks, exacerbating the situation for the populations already vulnerable to the disease [1]. The South and Grand’Anse regions, which were among the most heavily affected by the hurricane, were also identified as cholera vulnerability areas [1]. \n\nAdditionally, the hurricane hit at a time when the country was already dealing with residual cases of cholera, and the conditions created by the storm, such as flooding and poor sanitation, increased the likelihood of the disease spreading [1]. The lack of adequate infrastructure and the presence of displacement camps from the 2010 earthquake, where many people were still living, further heightened the risk of cholera transmission [2][3]. The combination of these factors created an environment conducive to the spread of cholera, leading to significant health challenges for the affected population.",

While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur.

      "question": "What specific early warning measures were implemented during the storm in Haiti, and how did these measures contribute to reducing fatalities according to news reports?",
      "answer": "During Hurricane Matthew, several early warning measures were implemented in Haiti to mitigate the impact of the storm. The Haitian Civil Protection Department, in collaboration with organizations like ACTED, conducted awareness sessions to prevent cholera and prepared for emergency interventions [1]. Civil protection officials actively walked the streets of Les Cayes, urging residents to secure their homes, prepare emergency kits, and warn their neighbors about the impending hurricane [2]. Additionally, shelters were opened, although initially, they were not occupied [2].\n\nDespite these efforts, the effectiveness of these measures in significantly reducing fatalities is not explicitly detailed in the sources. However, the proactive steps taken, such as evacuating vulnerable populations and conducting awareness campaigns, likely contributed to some level of preparedness among the population. For instance, in Les Anglais and Tiburon, local authorities reported that people fled to shelters as the storm approached, indicating that the warnings were heeded by some residents [3]. Furthermore, the evacuation of children from an orphanage in Cite Soleil and the transfer of detainees from a prison in Jeremie suggest that targeted evacuations were part of the strategy to protect vulnerable groups [3].",

The southern coast of the country is currently on hurricane alert status. Winds of up to 200 km/h, heavy rainfall and significant material damages are expected. While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur. ACTED teams are mobilized in southern Haiti to launch emergency operations according to the needs. ACTED teams are pre-positioned in the South and Grand’Anse regions",

Part of the seaport city of Les Cayes was underwater after being deluged by recent rains, which now are also being blamed for mudslides. \"We have already recorded a landslide between Les Cayes and Tiburon\" in Haiti's Sud department, Marie-Alta Jean-Baptiste, director of Haiti's civil protection told AFP. Haiti is home to almost 11 million people, many living in fragile housing. Thousands are still living in tents in Haiti after the country's massive earthquake in 2010. Erosion is especially dangerous because of high mountains and a lack of trees and bushes in areas where they have been cut for fuel.

Pearl says Mercy Corp volunteers already on the ground will assess the damage and begin to organize a response once the brunt of the storm has passed. But the toll from the storm could be enormous, she said. In Canaan, a flood-prone area where the agency works, more than 50% of the population living there lost homes in the earthquake, Pearl said. \"Many are still living in temporary shelters. Nationwide, some 60,000 are still living in displacement camps from the earthquake.\" And she says there is renewed concern about cholera. \"The Haitian people are still rebuilding their lives.

October 4, 2016 “We have gusts of wind hitting the whole area and the people have fled to a shelter,” said Les Anglais mayor Jean-Claude Despierre. In Tiburon, another town nearby, the mayor said people who had been reluctant to leave their homes also ran for cover when the sea rose. “Everyone is trying to find a safe place to protect themselves, the situation is very difficult,” mayor Remiza Denize said, describing large waves hitting the town. Poor Haiti ans are often loath to leave home in the face of storms, fearing their few belongings will be stolen. Civil protection authorities said 130 children were evacuated by bus to a high school in the capital from an orphanage in the shoreside Cite Soleil slum, made up of tin shacks and open sewers and known as Haiti ’s largest shanty town. On the north coast, about 300 detainees were transferred from their prison near the sea in the town of Jeremie, the interior ministry said. The cyclone comes at a bad time for Haiti , where tens of thousands of people still live in tents after a 2010 earthquake that killed upwards of 200,000 people. Cholera introduced by U.N. peacekeepers is expected to rise in the October rainy season, and the country was due to hold a long-delayed presidential election on Oct. 9.

We must sleep on the floor ... Everyone is hungry.\" The conditions in the shelter compared unfavourably with Haiti's neighbour Cuba, where authorities spent days organising teams of volunteers to move residents to safety and secure property. The storm is expected to make a direct hit later on Tuesday in the province of Guantanamo, the disputed home to a U.S. Naval base and military prison but also a small Cuban city. \"We are receiving people living in villages prone to flooding,\" said Alexis Iglesias, head of the evacuation committee at Guantanamo University which was being used as shelter. \"Food is guaranteed and we have a generator that will guarantee that the kitchen keeps on working in case of a power cut,\" he said, at the shelter, where some 400 people were staying. The U.S. Agency for International Development said on Monday it was providing a combined $400,000 in aid to Haiti and Jamaica.

Spoke to James our missionary assistant and he said his house is completely broken. Please keep praying.” The founder of the group hung on every image and word in spotty communication from the leader of the orphan transition homes her group supports in Les Cayes.

Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur. ACTED teams are mobilized in southern Haiti to launch emergency operations according to the needs. ACTED teams are pre-positioned in the South and Grand’Anse regions",

Marie Alta Jean-Baptiste, the director of the country's Civil Protection Agency, told the Associated Press that two fishermen died in turbulent waters from the approaching storm. Both deaths were in small fishing towns, near the southwestern coastal city of Les Cayes. Pearl says Mercy Corp volunteers already on the ground will assess the damage and begin to organize a response once the brunt of the storm has passed. But the toll from the storm could be enormous, she said. In Canaan, a flood-prone area where the agency works, more than 50% of the population living there lost homes in the earthquake, Pearl said. \"Many are still living in temporary shelters. Nationwide, some 60,000 are still living in displacement camps from the earthquake.\" And she says there is renewed concern about cholera. \"The Haitian people are still rebuilding their lives.

      "answer": "Following Hurricane Matthew, displacement significantly impacted the Haitian population, with many still living in temporary shelters from the 2010 earthquake, exacerbating their vulnerability to the storm's effects [1][2]. The hurricane caused further displacement, as people fled to shelters, and worsened living conditions, with reports of overcrowded shelters lacking food and electricity [3][4].",

The southern coast of the country is currently on hurricane alert status. Winds of up to 200 km/h, heavy rainfall and significant material damages are expected. While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur. ACTED teams are mobilized in southern Haiti to launch emergency operations according to the needs. ACTED teams are pre-positioned in the South and Grand’Anse regions",

October 4, 2016 “We have gusts of wind hitting the whole area and the people have fled to a shelter,” said Les Anglais mayor Jean-Claude Despierre. In Tiburon, another town nearby, the mayor said people who had been reluctant to leave their homes also ran for cover when the sea rose. “Everyone is trying to find a safe place to protect themselves, the situation is very difficult,” mayor Remiza Denize said, describing large waves hitting the town. Poor Haiti ans are often loath to leave home in the face of storms, fearing their few belongings will be stolen. Civil protection authorities said 130 children were evacuated by bus to a high school in the capital from an orphanage in the shoreside Cite Soleil slum, made up of tin shacks and open sewers and known as Haiti ’s largest shanty town. On the north coast, about 300 detainees were transferred from their prison near the sea in the town of Jeremie, the interior ministry said. The cyclone comes at a bad time for Haiti , where tens of thousands of people still live in tents after a 2010 earthquake that killed upwards of 200,000 people. Cholera introduced by U.N. peacekeepers is expected to rise in the October rainy season, and the country was due to hold a long-delayed presidential election on Oct. 9.

The storm is expected to make a direct hit later on Tuesday in the province of Guantanamo, the disputed home to a U.S. Naval base and military prison but also a small Cuban city. \"We are receiving people living in villages prone to flooding,\" said Alexis Iglesias, head of the evacuation committee at Guantanamo University which was being used as shelter. \"Food is guaranteed and we have a generator that will guarantee that the kitchen keeps on working in case of a power cut,\" he said, at the shelter, where some 400 people were staying.

Pearl says Mercy Corp volunteers already on the ground will assess the damage and begin to organize a response once the brunt of the storm has passed. But the toll from the storm could be enormous, she said. In Canaan, a flood-prone area where the agency works, more than 50% of the population living there lost homes in the earthquake, Pearl said. \"Many are still living in temporary shelters. Nationwide, some 60,000 are still living in displacement camps from the earthquake.\" And she says there is renewed concern about cholera. \"The Haitian people are still rebuilding their lives.

The southern coast of the country is currently on hurricane alert status. Winds of up to 200 km/h, heavy rainfall and significant material damages are expected. While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur.

We must sleep on the floor ... Everyone is hungry.\" The conditions in the shelter compared unfavourably with Haiti's neighbour Cuba, where authorities spent days organising teams of volunteers to move residents to safety and secure property. The storm is expected to make a direct hit later on Tuesday in the province of Guantanamo, the disputed home to a U.S. Naval base and military prison but also a small Cuban city. \"We are receiving people living in villages prone to flooding,\" said Alexis Iglesias, head of the evacuation committee at Guantanamo University which was being used as shelter. \"Food is guaranteed and we have a generator that will guarantee that the kitchen keeps on working in case of a power cut,\" he said, at the shelter, where some 400 people were staying. The U.S. Agency for International Development said on Monday it was providing a combined $400,000 in aid to Haiti and Jamaica. The agency said in a statement it had pre-positioned relief supplies and was preparing to ship in additional supplies to the central Caribbean.

The southern coast of the country is currently on hurricane alert status. Winds of up to 200 km/h, heavy rainfall and significant material damages are expected. While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur. ACTED teams are mobilized in southern Haiti to launch emergency operations according to the needs. ACTED teams are pre-positioned in the South and Grand’Anse regions",

      "question": "What evidence is there to demonstrate the role or impact of heavy rainfall during the storm in Haiti, and how did it contribute to the severity of the disaster?",
      "answer": "Heavy rainfall during Hurricane Matthew led to significant flooding and mudslides in Haiti, exacerbating the disaster's impact by submerging parts of Les Cayes and causing landslides between Les Cayes and Tiburon [1]. The heavy rains also heightened the risk of cholera outbreaks, particularly in vulnerable areas like the South and Grand’Anse regions, where cholera prevention efforts were already underway [2].",

But the toll from the storm could be enormous, she said. In Canaan, a flood-prone area where the agency works, more than 50% of the population living there lost homes in the earthquake, Pearl said. \"Many are still living in temporary shelters. Nationwide, some 60,000 are still living in displacement camps from the earthquake.\" And she says there is renewed concern about cholera. \"The Haitian people are still rebuilding their lives.

The southern coast of the country is currently on hurricane alert status. Winds of up to 200 km/h, heavy rainfall and significant material damages are expected. While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur.

The southern coast of the country is currently on hurricane alert status. Winds of up to 200 km/h, heavy rainfall and significant material damages are expected. While populations and infrastructures are unprepared to face such powerful winds, ACTED Haiti deployed an emergency team of 35 persons ahead of the hurricane. Tropical storm Matthew developed on 28 September south-east of Saint Lucia, with 97 km/h winds, before turning into a hurricane on 29 September. Haiti is on red alert status since the night of 1 October. Schools, airports and other infrastructures are currently closed until further notice. According to ACTED teams there, hurricane Matthew may be the most violent hurricane hitting Haiti since hurricane Hazel in 1954. The southern Haitian coast is expected to be hit by the eye of hurricane Matthew in the coming hours, and concerns are significant: material damages are unavoidable, and given the power of the hurricane, human casualties may occur. ACTED teams are mobilized in southern Haiti to launch emergency operations according to the needs. ACTED teams are pre-positioned in the South and Grand’Anse regions",

October 4, 2016 “We have gusts of wind hitting the whole area and the people have fled to a shelter,” said Les Anglais mayor Jean-Claude Despierre. In Tiburon, another town nearby, the mayor said people who had been reluctant to leave their homes also ran for cover when the sea rose. “Everyone is trying to find a safe place to protect themselves, the situation is very difficult,” mayor Remiza Denize said, describing large waves hitting the town. Poor Haiti ans are often loath to leave home in the face of storms, fearing their few belongings will be stolen. Civil protection authorities said 130 children were evacuated by bus to a high school in the capital from an orphanage in the shoreside Cite Soleil slum, made up of tin shacks and open sewers and known as Haiti ’s largest shanty town. On the north coast, about 300 detainees were transferred from their prison near the sea in the town of Jeremie, the interior ministry said. The cyclone comes at a bad time for Haiti , where tens of thousands of people still live in tents after a 2010 earthquake that killed upwards of 200,000 people. Cholera introduced by U.N. peacekeepers is expected to rise in the October rainy season, and the country was due to hold a long-delayed presidential election on Oct. 9. The office of Interim President Jocelerme Privert said there was no change to the election date",

Part of the seaport city of Les Cayes was underwater after being deluged by recent rains, which now are also being blamed for mudslides. \"We have already recorded a landslide between Les Cayes and Tiburon\" in Haiti's Sud department, Marie-Alta Jean-Baptiste, director of Haiti's civil protection told AFP. Haiti is home to almost 11 million people, many living in fragile housing. Thousands are still living in tents in Haiti after the country's massive earthquake in 2010. Erosion is especially dangerous because of high mountains and a lack of trees and bushes in areas where they have been cut for fuel. Interim President Jocelerme Privert in an address to the nation urged Haitians on Monday to do what they could to get out of the path of the storm.",

We must sleep on the floor ... Everyone is hungry.\" The conditions in the shelter compared unfavourably with Haiti's neighbour Cuba, where authorities spent days organising teams of volunteers to move residents to safety and secure property. The storm is expected to make a direct hit later on Tuesday in the province of Guantanamo, the disputed home to a U.S. Naval base and military prison but also a small Cuban city. \"We are receiving people living in villages prone to flooding,\" said Alexis Iglesias, head of the evacuation committee at Guantanamo University which was being used as shelter. \"Food is guaranteed and we have a generator that will guarantee that the kitchen keeps on working in case of a power cut,\" he said, at the shelter, where some 400 people were staying. The U.S. Agency for International Development said on Monday it was providing a combined $400,000 in aid to Haiti and Jamaica. The agency said in a statement it had pre-positioned relief supplies and was preparing to ship in additional supplies to the central Caribbean.

ACTED is collaborating with local stakeholders to deploy more extensive resources in case needed and to deliver aid from Port-au-Prince, in particular by plane. In the last days, in cooperation with the Haitian Civil Protection Department, ACTED teams in the field conducted awareness sessions to prevent cholera, while ensuring the follow-up of some residual cases of the disease. The cholera vulnerability areas in South and Grand’Anse regions are among the areas that are most likely to be heavily affected by hurricane Matthew. Heavy rains and floods that are most likely to occur may provoke new cholera outbreaks, thus exacerbating the situation that populations will face after hurricane Matthew. ACTED in Haiti. ACTED is present in Haiti since 2004 to support the most vulnerable populations, first in central Haiti, and in the whole country, especially in the South, since the emergency intervention after the 2010 earthquake. In the southern regions of Haiti, ACTED implements projects to improve sanitation and cholera prevention and support health infrastructures.

October 4, 2016 “We have gusts of wind hitting the whole area and the people have fled to a shelter,” said Les Anglais mayor Jean-Claude Despierre. In Tiburon, another town nearby, the mayor said people who had been reluctant to leave their homes also ran for cover when the sea rose. “Everyone is trying to find a safe place to protect themselves, the situation is very difficult,” mayor Remiza Denize said, describing large waves hitting the town. Poor Haiti ans are often loath to leave home in the face of storms, fearing their few belongings will be stolen. Civil protection authorities said 130 children were evacuated by bus to a high school in the capital from an orphanage in the shoreside Cite Soleil slum, made up of tin shacks and open sewers and known as Haiti ’s largest shanty town. On the north coast, about 300 detainees were transferred from their prison near the sea in the town of Jeremie, the interior ministry said. The cyclone comes at a bad time for Haiti , where tens of thousands of people still live in tents after a 2010 earthquake that killed upwards of 200,000 people. Cholera introduced by U.N. peacekeepers is expected to rise in the October rainy season, and the country was due to hold a long-delayed presidential election on Oct. 9. The office of Interim President Jocelerme Privert said there was no change to the election date",

PREVIOUS: Robertson County church prays for its Haitian orphans in hurricane’s path The Gallatin religious group supports what it calls “transition homes” for teens in Les Caye. Agape to the Nations Facebook page is keeping its supporters up to date with words from those on the ground. A post from this Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. reads: Our teens are safe. The boys house bottom floor is flooding so all the teens were moved upstairs.The girls house has lost every tree in the yard. Luckily they fell on the fence and wall. Spoke to James our missionary assistant and he said his house is completely broken. Please keep praying.” The founder of the group hung on every image and word in spotty communication from the leader of the orphan transition homes her group supports in Les Cayes. (Photo: WKRN) “He called me at six this morning when that video was sent,” said Agape founder Kinsley Smith from her office in Gallatin. “He said ‘it is just terrible, the rains and the winds just have not stopped,’ and then he asked me ‘when is it going to stop’ because they have no way of knowing.” Two thousand miles away from the destruction, at that very moment, Kinsley tried to comfort the Haitian who runs her group’s three homes",
